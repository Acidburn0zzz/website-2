Website & Curriculum
--------------------

If you'd like to help edit this site, `email edunham`_ or ping edunham on
Freenode with your github username to get access to the web site repo. You'll
also want to learn the `ReStructured Text`_ markup language to edit the site,
if you don't already know it. 

Meetings
--------

Our first meeting will be held twice: **Tuesday, October 15th** at 6pm in KEC1007, and
**Friday, October 18th** at 6pm in KEC1007. Recurring meeting times will be
decided based on the availability of those who show up for either session of
the first meeting. Note that we'll be presenting basically the same thing on
both Tuesday and Friday, so attend whichever one session works for you.
