Curriculum
==========

The curriculum will be constantly evolving as we develop this course. The
first unit will be an overview of what students will need to know in order to
understand the deeper technical concepts which will be covered later. 

Here's what we're hoping to mentor and teach students about:

#. Linux Basics
#. Basic System Administration
#. Basic FOSS Development Methodologies
#. Base infrastructure services for any organization (DNS, Email, etc)
#. Building a mock infrastructure for a mock company from top to bottom

.. note:: Note that the curriculum past week 4 is currently under development. Lesson
    titles are included to provide an overview of what we'll cover, but specific
    content is likely to get moved around between lessons depending on what we
    learn about the pace of the class during the first few weeks. 

    Slide content will be linked here as soon as it's drafted, but only finalized
    1-2 weeks before the lessons when it's presented.
