2013-10-29 11:51:05	justin	:/
2013-10-29 11:51:15	dean	i think the 'whole line' thing is confusing.
2013-10-29 11:51:31	justin	hmmm
2013-10-29 11:51:38	dean	can we go with karmabot style?
2013-10-29 11:51:46	justin	sure
2013-10-29 11:51:58	dean	in the middle of a line you can say foo++ and that increments foo. for spaces you can do (foo bar)++
2013-10-29 11:52:11	dean	it would be cool to ignore ++ inside a ()++ block.
2013-10-29 12:04:05	justin	ignore as in drop or ignore as in don't de/increment?
2013-10-29 12:07:45	dean	don't de/increment.
2013-10-29 12:08:02	dean	basically, if we could say that lance can deal with C++, I'd be happy because noone else can.
2013-10-29 12:08:13	dean	but it is a kind of silly edge case, so I should stop pushing it.

2013-10-29 13:48:44	justin	does plugin reloading work yet?
2013-10-29 13:53:01	dean	justin: maybe and no.
2013-10-29 13:53:06	dean	i think the plugins plugin is still broken.
2013-10-29 13:53:27	dean	but on a larger not, when we ditched exocet, we broke the ability to reload cahnges to code.
2013-10-29 13:53:38	dean	so it might be possible to unload a plugin and then reload, but you wont get new code changes cause python.
2013-10-29 13:53:49	justin	ah
2013-10-29 13:53:55	justin	shame
2013-10-29 13:54:28	dean	talk to dash and/or sean, see if they have any replacements for exocet.
2013-10-29 13:54:33	dean	then rewrite the plugin loader to use that.

2013-10-29 16:05:44	justin	beause i want to match more than just A-Za-z0-9_
2013-10-29 16:06:40	justin	you can have parens in your parens and not have issues and so forth

2013-10-29 16:06:52	justin	final correction
2013-10-29 16:07:05	justin	I will comment the heck out of this in code
2013-10-29 16:07:43	ken	yeah, i think the only way to redeem yourself now will be to write out in words *exactly* what it matches
2013-10-29 16:08:23	justin	will do, there's actually three major or statements in there that are easily discussable
2013-10-29 16:10:58	dean	justin: do you know about re.X mode?
2013-10-29 16:11:36	dean	I will not accept this code if you don't use this mode: http://docs.python.org/2.7/library/re.html#re.X
2013-10-29 16:22:55	justin	dean: i did that commenting above, breaking down the sections and so forth. BUT that just means I have some copypasta to do and add a param.
2013-10-29 16:23:08	 *	justin was not going to just give a regex string and be done with it :)
2013-10-29 16:23:17	dean	I'm mostly joking actually
2013-10-29 16:23:22	dean	comment it however you like.
2013-10-29 16:23:49	justin	how should karma handle something like ++ao++
2013-10-29 16:23:59	justin	currently ++ao would get +1 karma
2013-10-29 16:24:19	dean	other choices: ao gets +1 karma
2013-10-29 16:24:22	dean	or nothing happens.
2013-10-29 16:24:26	dean	All of these sound fine to me.
2013-10-29 16:25:03	justin	Currently ++ao as I said, but I'm leaning towards just ao
2013-10-29 16:25:34	justin	it's simply a .strip() vs .lstrip()
2013-10-29 16:25:38	ken	i'd say that ++ao would be right
2013-10-29 16:25:46	ken	so you can karma a flag, for instance
2013-10-29 16:25:50	ken	+b--
2013-10-29 16:26:21	dean	hmm. fair enough.

2013-10-30 08:32:42	justin	dean: username lookup works just fine actually (!karma <username>) though tab completion adds a space to the end. I'm thinking it's a bad idea to strip surrounding whitepace, but it's also an annoyance to the user. What are your thoughts?

2013-10-30 09:49:45	justin	prolly should just do:

2013-10-30 10:22:53	dean	yeah.
2013-10-30 10:23:10	dean	might be a bit tricky. You could probably catch the real commands.
2013-10-30 10:23:21	dean	but the things that look like commands but are implemented differently would be harder.
2013-10-30 10:23:58	ken	yeah, 'cause i'd like to see how often people use things that've been learnt as well
2013-10-30 10:24:38	dean	you could make a general stats thing, and then have all the plugins call back to it.
2013-10-30 10:25:46	ken	true

2013-11-06 10:07:41	ken	dean: i like the pizza behavior suggestion
2013-11-06 10:07:48	ken	though we need remove-topping for bkero :3
2013-11-06 10:07:48	lance	bkero what the hell was in that
2013-11-06 10:07:55	ken	lance: pizza.
2013-11-06 10:08:38	ken	except if we need to round any of the numbers to make even quantities, lance should be like "and a slice of $x for me makes y pies of z"
2013-11-06 10:08:45	ken	err s/z/x/
2013-11-06 10:08:50	ken	s/z/x/
2013-11-06 10:08:51	lance	ken actually meant: except if we need to round any of the numbers to make even quantities, lance should be like "and a slice of $x for me makes y pies of x"
2013-11-06 10:09:21	dean	i'm not sure what you mean with that last statement.
2013-11-06 10:09:33	dean	ooh. maybe instead of letting lance decide how many pizzas to get, tell it.
2013-11-06 10:09:59	dean	then it takes the top N choices, where N is twice the number of pizzas, and distributes them proportionally.
2013-11-06 10:10:35	ken	yeah
2013-11-06 10:10:48	ken	i mean if there are 4 slices per pie and only 3 people have voted
2013-11-06 10:10:55	ken	we need a 4th slice from somewhere
2013-11-06 10:11:02	ken	so Hamper should pretend that slice is for him :3
2013-11-06 10:11:06	dean	heh
2013-11-06 10:11:22	dean	oh, i see now.
2013-11-06 10:11:31	dean	though I don't think lance should think about slices.
2013-11-06 10:11:44	dean	i think, to be kind to Dominos, that half a pizza is probably the smallest unit lance should think about.
2013-11-06 10:12:05	ken	hmm true
2013-11-06 10:12:14	ken	well half a pizza is the smallest unit that should be ordered
2013-11-06 10:12:26	ken	but not everyone is gonna eat half a pizza to themself, y'know?
2013-11-06 10:13:44	dean	sure
2013-11-06 10:13:54	dean	so that is up to the person who starts pizza to decide.
2013-11-06 10:14:04	ken	ohh ok
2013-11-06 10:14:10	dean	like... as the MC of LUG, you decide that we should get 4 pizzas.
2013-11-06 10:14:28	ken	or maybe lance could recommend a distribution and quantity, then the MC can say "actually we need n pizzas" and Hamper redistributes
2013-11-06 10:15:12	dean	i think it would be a lot easier to do the suggestion algorithm if the number of pizzas is known.
2013-11-06 10:16:51	dean	2 pizzas: 3 votes: 2x pepperoni, 1x cheese: goal is 66% pepperoni, 33% cheese. closest rounding is 1.5 pepperoni, 0.5 cheese.
2013-11-06 10:17:40	dean	(just another example, not trying to suggest how the algorithm needs a known number of pizzas)
2013-11-06 10:17:45	ken	hmm ok
2013-11-06 10:18:02	ken	or like "x people voted, that probably means n pizzas, here's how you distribute to n pizzas"
2013-11-06 10:18:17	dean	that makes sense too.
2013-11-06 10:18:32	dean	you would have to assume a voters to population ratio.
2013-11-06 10:19:18	dean	which may be 1.0. I expect it would be more like 0.6
2013-11-06 10:19:26	dean	which, if that number is known and constant, is easy to account for.
2013-11-06 10:20:43	ken	i'm gonna say it's 1.0
2013-11-06 10:20:54	dean	ok.
2013-11-06 10:20:55	ken	i'm gonna teach lance to "x slices of y for z"
2013-11-06 10:21:10	dean	can you give an expanded example of that?
2013-11-06 10:21:34	ken	<ken> lance: pizza servings
2013-11-06 10:22:23	ken	<lance> I've ordered sausage for ken, mushroom for bkero and sean, and pepperoni and pineapple for dean
2013-11-06 10:22:23	lance	bkero what the hell was in that
2013-11-06 10:22:29	ken	<3 lance
2013-11-06 10:22:51	ken	then again, possibly also overkill
2013-11-06 10:23:01	ken	but it'd be a way to train people to actually vote, and lrn2irc
2013-11-06 10:23:17	dean	i would avoid "I've ordered", unless you plan on automating the ordering too.
2013-11-06 10:23:19	dean	which would be cool.
2013-11-06 10:23:32	ken	yeah, or "the order is" or whatever
2013-11-06 10:23:34	 *	ken bad at words
2013-11-06 10:24:08	ken	or maybe not; i dunno
2013-11-06 10:24:27	ken	maybe i could just count raised hands for the total population
2013-11-06 10:24:34	ken	and tell lance that, and get the ratio from there
2013-11-06 10:25:48	dean	or just tell lance how many pizzas to order :3
2013-11-06 10:25:55	dean	but anyways, i think this is really cool.
2013-11-06 10:26:46	ken	yeah :3
2013-11-06 10:27:00	ken	using robots to solve being bad at social skills and maths
2013-11-06 10:27:18	ken	also my new rule for lug is that we're not getting pizza until someone writes the plugin
2013-11-06 10:27:22	ken	so please don't write it for us :)
2013-11-06 10:27:48	dean	got it :)
2013-11-06 10:29:00	dean	and i assume "Someone" isn't going to be you?
2013-11-06 10:29:14	ken	will be if i have time
2013-11-06 10:29:20	ken	but kids need to learn to lance

2013-11-06 16:16:57	dean	I defer to ken and the rest of the lug admins on what behavior lance takes in #osu-lug
2013-11-06 16:16:59	dean	sure.
2013-11-06 16:22:28	ken	basically lance's allowed anything in lug until it becomes abused and problematic
2013-11-06 18:45:49	amber	I started working on a polling system for lance last night btw :D
2013-11-06 18:54:38	dean	amber: cool. is this for pizza?
2013-11-06 18:54:44	dean	or unrelated?
2013-11-06 19:52:58	amber	pizza is the primary goal, but it could be used for anything.
2013-11-06 19:53:34	amber	Command will look like: !poll <option1> [option2 .. option10] [time in minutes for poll to last]
2013-11-06 19:53:48	amber	Oops, and a title for the poll.
2013-11-06 19:58:28	dean	ah. ken and i have been talking about a pizza specific plugin recently.
2013-11-06 19:58:47	dean	amber: did you see the issue ken filed?
2013-11-06 20:53:42	amber	Nope, but I'll check now.
2013-11-06 20:56:20	amber	So, the dominos portion could go into the subject of the poll (for example).

2013-11-08 22:03:13	dean	i was more concerned with the partial functionality.

2013-11-18 20:15:32	jim	damn
2013-11-18 20:15:35	--	jim is now known as dean
2013-11-18 20:16:43	dean	ian: for some reason, your messages aren't matching the regex.
2013-11-18 20:16:50	dean	the regex is '^roulette$'
2013-11-18 20:17:08	ian	No !?
2013-11-18 20:17:20	dean	lance strips those.
2013-11-18 20:17:24	ian	Ah
2013-11-18 20:17:36	dean	kind of.
2013-11-18 20:17:53	ian	Also, isn?t regex to match exactly one string somewhat inefficient?
2013-11-18 20:18:23	dean	sure.
2013-11-18 20:18:44	dean	roulette uses a generic interface to lance that gives an easy way to make commands.
2013-11-18 20:18:48	ian	Like using a bulldozer to find a China... cup...
2013-11-18 20:18:50	dean	you provide a regex, it calls you when you need it.
2013-11-18 20:19:27	dean	other commands use the full power of regex. just because roulette is simple doesn't justify having another helper.
2013-11-18 20:19:39	ian	ok
2013-11-18 20:19:55	ian	Well, I do use regex to parse incoming and outgoing data.
2013-11-18 20:20:27	ian	re.findall(r"^:(.+?)(?:!(.+?)@(.+?))?\s+(.+?)(?:\s+(.+?)(?:\s+(.+?))??)??(?:\s+:(.*))?$",line)
2013-11-18 20:20:34	dean	that's horrible.
2013-11-18 20:20:41	ian	It works.
2013-11-18 20:20:45	dean	it's unmaintainable.
2013-11-18 20:21:04	ian	I have not had to change it in years.
2013-11-18 20:21:43	dean	that doesn't change that it's horrible.

2013-11-20 13:21:37	angel	dean: what do you think about being able to add a tag to quotes?
2013-11-20 13:21:51	angel	so you could run !mike
2013-11-20 13:21:57	angel	but then also !mike nsa
2013-11-20 13:22:09	angel	and it would run on a subset of !mike for quotes that were tagged nsa
2013-11-20 13:22:13	dean	angel: I'd rather the syntax be like !quote #mike
2013-11-20 13:22:34	dean	but that sounds totally fine.
2013-11-20 13:22:41	dean	you are just talking about being able to search in quotes, yeah?
2013-11-20 13:22:47	angel	where mike is a channel or a topic?
2013-11-20 13:23:09	angel	because right now, just !mike would be like !quote #mike
2013-11-20 13:23:20	dean	well, !mike is actually something that is in !learn
2013-11-20 13:23:23	dean	right now.
2013-11-20 13:23:26	angel	right
2013-11-20 13:23:29	angel	that's how we've been doing quotes
2013-11-20 13:23:39	dean	I don't want !quote to add a bevy of other ! commands, it pollutes the namespace.
2013-11-20 13:23:54	angel	so you think it'd be better if we started using !quote instead?
2013-11-20 13:23:57	dean	so like, earlier I tagged something with the hashtag #crypto
2013-11-20 13:24:04	dean	yes. using !quote would be great.
2013-11-20 13:24:37	angel	so perhaps we could add a column to the db for comma separated tags for each quote?
2013-11-20 13:24:40	dean	so you could do something like !quote #crypto, which would do something similar to  SELECT * FROM `quotes` WHERE `text` LIKE '%#crypto%';
2013-11-20 13:24:46	angel	ah
2013-11-20 13:24:50	dean	we could do that.
2013-11-20 13:24:57	dean	or we could just enable full text search on the quotes.
2013-11-20 13:25:02	angel	in my case, the tag is just metadata
2013-11-20 13:25:09	dean	sure.
2013-11-20 13:25:11	angel	whereas there, the tag shows up in the quote which doesn't seem idea
2013-11-20 13:25:13	angel	ideal
2013-11-20 13:25:17	dean	ah.
2013-11-20 13:25:20	dean	good point.
2013-11-20 13:25:29	dean	i think you have a good handle on how quote is used, and what we want on it.
2013-11-20 13:25:34	angel	cool ^^
2013-11-20 13:25:37	dean	I can edit the database to make any schema changes you want.
2013-11-20 13:25:45	dean	feel free to hack something together :D
2013-11-20 13:25:49	angel	I'll take a look at the quote code
2013-11-20 13:25:58	dean	quote is pretty easy.
2013-11-20 13:25:59	angel	I would just need a "tag" column for the quotes
2013-11-20 13:26:12	dean	yep
2013-11-20 13:49:27	angel	https://github.com/dean/lance/blob/master/lance/commander.py
2013-11-20 13:49:40	dean	angel: ...?
2013-11-20 13:49:41	angel	dean: I'm getting an 'invalid syntax' error on line 60 at the .format()
2013-11-20 13:49:57	angel	any idea what that's about?
2013-11-20 13:50:00	dean	angel: are you using python 2.7?
2013-11-20 13:50:04	angel	I believe so
2013-11-20 13:50:09	dean	i don't think you are.
2013-11-20 13:50:12	angel	ok ^^
2013-11-20 13:50:13	dean	I bet you are using python3
2013-11-20 13:50:34	dean	because that line is a syntax error in py3, but not python2.7
2013-11-20 13:50:43	dean	to tell: python --version
2013-11-20 13:51:34	angel	for some reason, I was thinking PYTHONPATH=. was using some python locally
2013-11-20 13:51:36	angel	but that's not the case
2013-11-20 13:51:53	dean	nope
2013-11-20 13:52:00	dean	you should make a virtualenv with python2.
2013-11-20 13:52:13	dean	then make sure to activate it.
2013-11-20 13:52:14	angel	ah I remember you helping me with that now
2013-11-20 13:52:22	angel	that's why it's not working this time. I'll do that
2013-11-20 13:52:57	dean	if you have a virtualenv2 command, you should use that on.e
2013-11-20 13:53:19	sean	ARCH HOOOOOUSE!!!!
2013-11-20 13:54:33	dean	sean: arch is not the only distro that defaults to python3.
2013-11-20 13:54:43	sean	dean: Fair enough.
2013-11-20 13:55:19	dean	i can't cite specific (besides gentoo), but I don't think it is unreasonable to make them both available.
2013-11-20 13:55:27	angel	sean: yeah, arch o:
2013-11-20 13:55:38	angel	python2 is available but it's called python2
2013-11-20 13:55:51	angel	I haven't bothered seeing if I can change python to point to python2 without breaking things
2013-11-20 13:56:07	sean	angel: Don't bother; you picked an intentionally-broken distro. Just be aware of it. :3
2013-11-20 13:56:32	dean	angel: it will break things in arch.
2013-11-20 13:56:45	dean	just use virtualenvs for everything that you need py2 for.
2013-11-20 13:56:55	angel	sean: how is it broken? o.0
2013-11-20 13:57:36	dean	angel: arch has the policy of aggresively switching to new versions of things, and some of the maintainers are pretty crazy for other reasons besides. this has caused some breakage. sean does not like these things about arch.
2013-11-20 13:57:41	sean	angel: Ruby, Python, Perl installations all broken at one time or another by deliberate ignorance of upstream's packaging instructions.
2013-11-20 13:58:27	dean	sean: fwiw, i think Ruby upstream is a little to blame for how broken ruby got.
2013-11-20 13:58:41	dean	python2 and 3 can co-exist.
2013-11-20 13:58:56	sean	dean: This is true.
2013-11-20 13:58:56	dean	but ruby 1.7 and 1.8 just clobber eachother, and are really incompatible.
2013-11-20 13:59:20	angel	ah ok
2013-11-20 13:59:27	sean	But the executable "python" being anything besides Python 1/2.x is unreasonable.
2013-11-20 13:59:38	dean	Python 1?
2013-11-20 14:00:00	dean	i think that would be unreasonable.
2013-11-20 14:00:13	sean	All Python 1 code (and there exists some even today!) is valid Python 2 code, except for new keywords like "with".
2013-11-20 14:00:28	dean	i think that something that is unreasonable in other distros and/or upstream (I don't know where it comes from) is the resistance to making both /usr/bin/python2 and /usr/bin/python3, regardless of what the default is.
2013-11-20 14:00:39	sean	Python 2 and Python 3 are different languages. I just mentioned it because I'm quite confident that there *are* machines in the wild that have a Python 1 for their Python.
2013-11-20 14:00:52	dean	i see. i was unaware of that.
2013-11-20 14:00:59	dean	so in arch, if I know I want python2 or python3, I can say so.
2013-11-20 14:01:27	dean	but on Ubuntu, I can't specify that explicitly, I have to implicitly rely on the system having python 2.x be the /usr/bin/python
2013-11-20 14:02:10	dean	aaaanyways.
2013-11-20 14:02:18	sean	Sorry. Didn't mean to start anything. :3
2013-11-20 14:02:27	sean	I was just trying to make a joke.
2013-11-20 14:02:32	dean	ah, sorry.
2013-11-20 14:05:49	 *	angel knows nothing about arch politics
2013-11-20 14:06:29	angel	I just found it interesting to build everything from a fairly basic starting point
2013-11-20 14:07:30	dean	you should try gentoo :3
2013-11-20 14:07:37	dean	(no you shouldn't)
2013-11-20 14:07:46	angel	I actually used gentoo for a couple months
2013-11-20 14:07:58	angel	I got tired of recompiling open office and firefox
2013-11-20 14:10:21	dean	yeah, you don't compile those.
2013-11-20 14:10:52	angel	also, I never figured out all the package masking errors
2013-11-20 14:11:41	dean	exactly

2013-11-22 10:03:47	emily	https://github.com/emily/lance/blob/master/lance/commander.py#L54 put self.msg("NickServ", "identify %s" % pass) right there?

2013-11-22 10:19:07	emily	so this works http://stackoverflow.com/a/13726645
2013-11-22 10:19:15	emily	need to put it in a callback or something

2013-11-22 10:20:47	dean	tbh, I've basically forgot how to async in python.
2013-11-22 10:20:50	dean	too much node.
2013-11-22 10:20:52	emily	lol
2013-11-22 10:21:31	dean	ideally you would send the command, then listen for messages until you got the message that said you were authed.
2013-11-22 10:21:33	emily	who tells me that I'm authed again?
2013-11-22 10:21:35	emily	yeah
2013-11-22 10:21:53	dean	i think nickserv does.
2013-11-22 10:23:10	dean	hmm. maybe not.
2013-11-22 10:23:26	dean	i think it is a notice from nickserv.

2013-11-22 10:59:17	emily	is the bot in lug more featureful than the default one?
2013-11-22 10:59:57	ken	afaik lug bot is running from not-just-master
2013-11-22 11:00:11	dean	the lug bot used to run from not-just-master, but not anymore.
2013-11-22 11:00:16	dean	i fixed that last night.
2013-11-22 11:00:23	dean	emily: by default the bot doesn't load any plugins.
2013-11-22 11:00:35	dean	the lug bot has a rather generous list of plugins to load
2013-11-22 11:00:45	emily	can I get that list?
2013-11-22 11:00:51	dean	yes
2013-11-22 11:00:53	dean	 ["botsnack","channelutils","choices","dice","factoids","flip","friendly","help","karma","ponies","quit","quotes","rot13","roulette","sed","yesno"]
2013-11-22 11:00:54	lance	OMG!!! PONIES!!!
2013-11-22 11:00:57	dean	exactly.
2013-11-22 11:01:22	dean	the not-just-master branch was actually the heroku branch, and almost always just contained the config file and an extra line in requirements.txt.
2013-11-22 11:01:45	dean	but now i figured out how to sanely get that requirement in the normal file, and shoved all the config into the heroku environment variables. which is awesome.
2013-11-22 11:01:51	dean	so now we are deploying straight from master.
2013-11-22 11:18:01	emily	  is there something I need to do to add a new plugin?
2013-11-22 11:18:06	emily	my plugin isn't being found
2013-11-22 11:18:36	emily	https://pastebin.mozilla.org/3654953
2013-11-22 11:18:57	emily	during startup I get: No plugin matched pattern "tinyurl"
2013-11-22 11:19:48	dean	yeah, you need to make an instance of the class
2013-11-22 11:19:57	dean	at the end do tinyurl = TinyUrl()
2013-11-22 11:20:01	dean	(it's dumb)
2013-11-22 11:20:08	emily	oh, I have that
2013-11-22 11:20:13	emily	I missed it in the pastebin
2013-11-22 11:20:36	dean	ah
2013-11-22 11:20:38	emily	https://pastebin.mozilla.org/3654975
2013-11-22 11:20:50	emily	is ChatPlugin the right mixin?
2013-11-22 11:20:54	dean	yeah.
2013-11-22 11:21:13	dean	plugins will fail to load if the interface isn't fulfilled, but I don't see anything obviously wrong.
2013-11-22 11:22:36	dean	in commander.py, at the end of CommanderFactory's __init__, you could add a print to see what plugins are being found from getPlugins()
2013-11-22 11:24:44	emily	interesting, the 'No plugin matched pattern "tinyurl"' happens before __init__ finishes

2013-11-22 11:39:05	dean	:D
2013-11-22 11:39:25	dean	are you going to try and run it on paas? or just on a box somewhere?
2013-11-22 11:39:29	emily	some box
2013-11-22 11:39:32	emily	but
2013-11-22 11:39:41	emily	err yeah, some box
2013-11-22 11:39:45	dean	lance already runs on heroku. getting it running on stackato shouldn't be too hard.
2013-11-22 11:39:54	emily	the bot is in some sensative channels
2013-11-22 11:40:04	dean	ah. and you don't trust stackato well enough?
2013-11-22 11:40:35	emily	kind of
2013-11-22 11:40:46	dean	fair enough.
2013-11-22 11:41:05	emily	trying to get help working for karma
2013-11-22 11:41:13	dean	you need to modify the help plugin.
2013-11-22 11:41:16	emily	we should be using getPlugins(BaseInterface, package=plugins) to find all the plugins
2013-11-22 11:41:19	emily	yeah, working onit
2013-11-22 11:41:26	dean	write now it only looks at plugin.commands.
2013-11-22 11:41:43	dean	it needs to also look at plugin itself for help info.
2013-11-22 11:47:37	emily	uhg, this is annoying
2013-11-22 11:51:52	dean	hmm?
2013-11-22 11:52:41	dean	emily: couldn't you just add 'commands.update(plugin)` after commands.update(plugins.commands)  ?
2013-11-22 11:53:38	emily	got something
2013-11-22 12:04:28	emily	I see what you are talking about now
2013-11-22 12:04:39	emily	help comes from <plugin>.commands
2013-11-22 12:04:48	emily	we need to look for help in <plugin>
2013-11-22 12:08:16	dean	mmhmm
2013-11-22 12:08:46	emily	well
2013-11-22 12:08:54	emily	karma is doing its help stuff differently
2013-11-22 12:09:00	dean	yeah
2013-11-22 12:09:03	emily	its putting all the help at the top level command
2013-11-22 12:09:07	dean	but i think the way karma does it is totally valid.
2013-11-22 12:09:12	emily	true
2013-11-22 12:09:16	emily	I think I can add this behavior
2013-11-22 12:13:35	emily	!flip is broken
2013-11-22 12:13:44	dean	you wrote it.
2013-11-22 12:13:50	emily	X)
2013-11-22 12:13:57	dean	but yes, it is broken. I think it is a unicode thing
2013-11-22 12:14:05	emily	fucking unicode
2013-11-22 12:14:05	dean	like... you have to en/decode it before sending it or something.
2013-11-22 12:14:17	dean	twisted irc doesn't like non-byte strings
2013-11-22 12:14:25	emily	yeah
2013-11-22 12:14:34	emily	well, I think I have enough to replace wesley
2013-11-22 12:14:37	sean	I blame IRC, personally.
2013-11-22 12:14:50	emily	let me push this patch dean

2013-11-22 12:23:52	dean	but we can fix that later.
2013-11-22 12:24:04	dean	or not.
2013-11-22 12:24:08	 *	dean shrugs
2013-11-22 12:24:14	-->	GitHub78 (~GitHub78@192.30.252.48) has joined #lance
2013-11-22 12:24:14	--	Notice(GitHub78): [lance] dean deleted 12factor at af5dbbf: http://git.io/aS3nng
2013-11-22 12:24:14	<--	GitHub78 (~GitHub78@192.30.252.48) has left #lance
2013-11-22 12:24:35	emily	I will rewrite history later ;)
2013-11-22 12:33:57	emily	wait, is there command acls yet?
2013-11-22 12:34:03	dean	....no
2013-11-22 12:34:07	emily	fuuuuuuu
2013-11-22 12:34:25	emily	I might have to hardcode some stuff
2013-11-22 12:34:55	dean	maybe it's time to add acls.
2013-11-22 13:26:38	emily	how do you propose we do that?
2013-11-22 13:27:54	emily	this is where xml configs are nice
2013-11-22 13:28:09	dean	have you worked with minecraft/bucket configs?
2013-11-22 13:28:15	dean	how is xml nice for this?
2013-11-22 13:29:04	dean	basically, this is my idea: people are in groups. people or groups have a list of permissions, which are just strings, and normally take the form of something like 'quotes.add'.
2013-11-22 13:29:45	dean	each plugin checks for a particular permission like  if not hasPermission(comm, 'quotes.add'): raise "ahhh"
2013-11-22 13:30:18	dean	people or groups may have permissions assigned to them, probably with the option to restrict it to a particular set of channels.
2013-11-22 13:30:21	emily	have I not worked with minecraft/bucket configs
2013-11-22 13:30:31	dean	not sure if sarcasm or denial.
2013-11-22 13:30:47	emily	seriously, I've never played minecraft
2013-11-22 13:30:57	dean	your wording did not imply that.
2013-11-22 13:31:20	dean	it sounded like "oh have I ever worked with those configs" as in "i've worked with those configs way too much"
2013-11-22 13:31:26	dean	because s/have I/I have/
2013-11-22 13:31:40	emily	heh, my grammar is weak
2013-11-22 13:32:24	emily	how would the config file look for these bucket perm things?
2013-11-22 13:32:34	dean	I'm writing something up.
2013-11-22 13:32:45	emily	k
2013-11-22 13:39:51	dean	https://github.com/dean/lance/issues/29
2013-11-22 13:41:51	dean	emily: ^
2013-11-22 13:44:35	emily	is the command being run in comm?
2013-11-22 13:45:05	dean	no.
2013-11-22 13:45:19	dean	comm is a bundle of data that includes the username, the message, the channel, etc.
2013-11-22 13:45:28	emily	where is the engine that parses the raw message to find the command?
2013-11-22 13:45:29	dean	it is passed to all plugins when they are called.
2013-11-22 13:45:36	dean	this happens after that.
2013-11-22 13:45:45	dean	this is like django permissions.
2013-11-22 13:45:55	dean	the view has to know to check permissions.
2013-11-22 13:46:18	dean	so, the core isn't checking permissions, just providing information. the plugins check permissions.
2013-11-22 13:46:28	dean	this way you can have permissions for things the core doesn't want to parse.
2013-11-22 13:46:28	emily	right
2013-11-22 13:47:26	emily	so when we pass comm to hasPermission the command must be known so hasPermission can look it up in the ACL blob
2013-11-22 13:47:43	emily	right?
2013-11-22 13:48:02	dean	that's what the second parameter is for.
2013-11-22 13:48:12	emily	ah, okay
2013-11-22 13:48:21	emily	I see where you are going with this
2013-11-22 13:48:32	dean	so there is nothing stoping the quotes plugin from asking if someone has the ponies permission
2013-11-22 13:48:32	lance	OMG!!! PONIES!!!
2013-11-22 13:48:55	dean	lance: learn that !shutup is <me> eats paste.
2013-11-22 13:48:55	lance	OK, dean
2013-11-22 13:49:02	dean	lance: shutup
2013-11-22 13:49:03	 *	lance eats paste.
2013-11-22 13:49:07	dean	botsnack
2013-11-22 13:49:14	emily	would we would need to invert the acl blob to be indexed by <plugin>.<action>?
2013-11-22 13:49:34	dean	that's an implementation detail.
2013-11-22 13:49:53	dean	i was thinking you take the comm object (user, channel, etc), and run it through the keys in permissions
2013-11-22 13:50:13	dean	if at least one blob hsa a positive permission, and none have a negative permission, you allow it.
2013-11-22 13:50:27	dean	maybe performance wise it could be inverted, but i haven't really thought about it.
2013-11-22 13:55:14	dean	does that sound like it would fit your needs?
2013-11-22 13:55:55	dean	ken: do you have thoughts on issue #29, linked above? (general purpose ACLs)
2013-11-22 13:56:02	emily	I don't know if your example covers per channel acls, but the general framework is good
2013-11-22 13:56:20	dean	it does cover per channel acls.
2013-11-22 13:56:35	dean	'emily#secretchannel' [ 'channel.leave' ]
2013-11-22 13:56:36	emily	"emily#secretchannel" ?
2013-11-22 13:56:38	dean	yeah
2013-11-22 13:56:45	dean	"emily can also ask lance to leave a channel, but only in #secretchannel"
2013-11-22 13:57:18	dean	maybe we would need channel groups too. i haven't thought about the per-channel stuff before today.
2013-11-22 13:57:26	emily	I need "lance can only do foo in channel X"
2013-11-22 13:58:16	emily	maybe flag a command as being whilelist only
2013-11-22 13:58:19	emily	*white list
2013-11-22 13:58:46	dean	oh, that's what i was thinking. everything is whitelist.
2013-11-22 13:58:53	dean	if the config doesn't mention you and that permission, you can't do it.
2013-11-22 13:59:07	 *	ken looks
2013-11-22 13:59:11	emily	dean: cool
2013-11-22 13:59:21	dean	there is also '*'
2013-11-22 13:59:40	dean	which is the permissions 'can do anything'
2013-11-22 13:59:43	dean	like Django's superuser.
2013-11-22 13:59:45	emily	I am seeking to deploy lance in hostile environments :)
2013-11-22 14:00:05	dean	oh. i see what you mean.
2013-11-22 14:00:36	dean	so I guess you could also do something like  '#somechannel': ['quote.add']
2013-11-22 14:00:53	dean	which would mean in #somechannel anyone can do ['quote.add']
2013-11-22 14:00:53	emily	oh shoot, I will also need to patch !seen if its works like I think it works
2013-11-22 14:01:10	dean	patch it how if what works the way you think?
2013-11-22 14:01:32	emily	does it work per channel?
2013-11-22 14:01:53	emily	like can I be in #foo and be told that someone was seen in #bar ?
2013-11-22 14:02:01	dean	ah.
2013-11-22 14:02:03	dean	i don't know.
2013-11-22 14:02:05	ken	dean: your ACL format is easy to read and makes sense to me. it seems the hard part would be coercing plugins to behave correctly and check ACLs.
2013-11-22 14:02:20	dean	ken: yes. each plugin would need to be written with acls.
2013-11-22 14:02:30	dean	but... i don't know how to do what I want without that.
2013-11-22 14:02:51	dean	emily: you probably get the full message 'so and so joined in channel #X' (except as a dict)
2013-11-22 14:02:59	ken	it'd have to be super coarse, like all-or-nothing per channel, to do it without hacking the plugins
2013-11-22 14:03:45	dean	yeah.
2013-11-22 14:03:55	dean	like 'this plugin will never run for this user in this channel'
2013-11-22 14:03:59	dean	which... i'm not a fan of.
2013-11-22 14:04:07	emily	huh, seen isn't backed by the db
2013-11-22 14:04:16	 *	dean didn't write seen.
2013-11-22 14:04:34	emily	alec!
2013-11-22 14:05:08	sean	dean: BTW, why does lance have stuff to try to do NAMES?
2013-11-22 14:05:28	dean	sean: for !seen. again. alec.
2013-11-22 14:05:50	dean	is it time to start getting really picky about style and code quality in lance?
2013-11-22 14:05:52	sean	Oh. Can that be nuked?
2013-11-22 14:05:54	dean	lance: what do you think?
2013-11-22 14:05:55	lance	dean: I think... Yes.
2013-11-22 14:06:11	dean	sean: we don't use seen in lug's lance. that's the only lance I really care about.
2013-11-22 14:06:12	emily	most of seen probably needs to be rewritten
2013-11-22 14:06:18	sean	Yes.
2013-11-22 14:06:27	dean	shall we just nuke seen, and re-make it better at some point?
2013-11-22 14:06:29	sean	dean: I mean, can we nuke the NAMES code?
2013-11-22 14:06:41	emily	so
2013-11-22 14:06:48	sean	The seen plugin doesn't need to be trashed; just removing the NAMES stuff would make it good enough for now.
2013-11-22 14:07:13	emily	sean: what is wrong with names? do you know how hackabot did this? It logged *everything*... is that better?
2013-11-22 14:07:22	dean	sean: hmm. so what is wrong with the NAMES stuff?
2013-11-22 14:07:37	sean	emily: You don't have to log everything, just the most recent time somebody said something and (preflex-style) what they said.
2013-11-22 14:07:40	dean	like, it doesn't seem to deserve nuking to me.
2013-11-22 14:07:42	ken	logs are a pretty cool story really
2013-11-22 14:07:45	sean	And also, preflex-style, which channel they said it on.
2013-11-22 14:07:51	ken	or just log joins?
2013-11-22 14:07:57	sean	dean: NAMES is fundamentally broken and we shouldn't even attempt it.
2013-11-22 14:07:59	ken	(to catch lurkers)
2013-11-22 14:08:09	dean	sean: oh, outside of lance?
2013-11-22 14:08:17	dean	like, irc's support for NAMES is stupid?
2013-11-22 14:08:22	sean	And yes, if you want to have a rough idea of who's in a channel, update the channel list with joins and parts.
2013-11-22 14:08:35	sean	Yes. NAMES in IRC is broken, because you cannot associate it with a channel.
2013-11-22 14:08:40	dean	ah
2013-11-22 14:08:44	dean	well that's dumb.
2013-11-22 14:08:50	sean	When one joins a channel, one gets a partial name list. Update that with parts and joins.
2013-11-22 14:09:00	dean	ok.
2013-11-22 14:09:12	sean	I'd write this myself, but I'm not quite ready to page out Baskerville stuff.
2013-11-22 14:09:32	dean	if it makes you feel better, this isn't affecting our lance right now.
2013-11-22 14:09:41	dean	but if you did a pr to nuke it all, I'd probably merge it.
2013-11-22 14:09:50	dean	since I don't really care about !seen.
2013-11-22 14:09:51	 *	emily grumbles
2013-11-22 14:10:00	dean	emily: what is the grumbling for?
2013-11-22 14:10:06	emily	thats one of the plugins people use in it
2013-11-22 14:10:17	emily	tinyurl, seen, and score
2013-11-22 14:10:18	dean	emily: i could upgrade seen to 'i care' status.
2013-11-22 14:10:19	emily	are the most popular
2013-11-22 14:10:22	emily	dean: :)
2013-11-22 14:10:30	emily	no, its fine
2013-11-22 14:10:32	dean	if we can prove it's working and not busted.
2013-11-22 14:10:40	emily	ACLs are the biggest thing right now for me
2013-11-22 14:10:52	dean	my lack of caring is because a) I don't know if it's busted or not. b) #lug doesn't use it.
2013-11-22 14:10:55	emily	if I have ACLs I will put lance in #it and a handful of other backchannels
2013-11-22 14:11:03	dean	fun.
2013-11-22 14:12:53	sean	Does !seen actually work?
2013-11-22 14:13:04	sean	'Cause from what I can tell, it probably can't actually work .
2013-11-22 14:13:10	emily	haha
2013-11-22 14:13:19	dean	i could load it into lance and we could find out.
2013-11-22 14:13:20	dean	should I?
2013-11-22 14:15:49	ken	sure :)
2013-11-22 14:16:50	<--	lance (~lance@ec2-23-22-49-24.compute-1.amazonaws.com) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2013-11-22 14:17:05	-->	lance (~lance@ec2-50-17-123-232.compute-1.amazonaws.com) has joined #lance
2013-11-22 14:17:20	dean	that seemed faster than normal.
2013-11-22 14:17:35	dean	oh, neat. because just changing config doesn't do a full rebuild. nice!
2013-11-22 14:17:58	dean	!seen dean
2013-11-22 14:17:58	lance	Seen dean at 10:17 PM on Nov-22
2013-11-22 14:18:21	dean	seems to at least have a little functionality.
2013-11-22 14:18:23	dean	!seen sean
2013-11-22 14:18:23	lance	I have not seen sean
2013-11-22 14:18:33	dean	but, as predicted, the NAMES thing doesn't do anything at all.
2013-11-22 14:18:38	dean	!seen baylesj
2013-11-22 14:18:38	lance	Seen baylesj at 10:17 PM on Nov-22
2013-11-22 14:18:46	dean	and it works cross channel.
2013-11-22 14:18:47	sean	So, I like what preflex does.
2013-11-22 14:18:49	sean	!seen sean
2013-11-22 14:18:49	lance	Seen sean at 10:18 PM on Nov-22
2013-11-22 14:18:59	dean	sean: what is preflex?
2013-11-22 14:19:07	dean	and what does it do?
2013-11-22 14:19:27	dean	!seen lance
2013-11-22 14:19:28	lance	I am always here!
2013-11-22 14:19:28	sean	preflex says *where* he saw you, and also what you last said; he also shows the timestamp relative to the current time ("2 days, 13 hours, 2 minutes ago").
2013-11-22 14:19:39	dean	those all sound like good things.
2013-11-22 14:19:43	sean	preflex is just a bot that provides !seen and !xseen for a bunch of channels.
2013-11-22 14:20:00	sean	Are you in e.g. #haskell?
2013-11-22 14:20:04	dean	i am not.
2013-11-22 14:21:01	dean	sean: i would welcome patches to lance that make !seen work like preflex's
2013-11-22 14:21:06	sean	That's all.
2013-11-22 14:21:12	 *	sean avoids spamming #haskell too much
2013-11-22 14:21:28	dean	I will make an issue, so that doesn't get forgotten.
2013-11-22 14:22:13	ken	haha that's where you really regret it if you said something dumb last
2013-11-22 14:23:08	sean	The reason that it remembers what you said is for things like "* sean goes to take the SO someplace nice for dinner"
2013-11-22 14:23:29	ken	yeah
2013-11-22 14:23:38	ken	makes sense
2013-11-22 14:24:54	dean	sean: good summary? https://github.com/dean/lance/issues/30
2013-11-22 14:25:10	dean	also, I think !xseen should not print the message.
2013-11-22 14:25:41	dean	because, what if the last thing I said was in a secure channel and was "and your new password is kajshdklash"
2013-11-22 14:26:21	ken	dean: it should be seen-in-channel
2013-11-22 14:26:27	ken	based on channel where asked
2013-11-22 14:26:40	dean	ken: !seen is in channel. !xseen is across all channels (or I misunderstood)
2013-11-22 14:26:45	ken	ohhhh ok
2013-11-22 14:26:48	ken	that would make sense
2013-11-22 14:27:01	sean	Yep.
2013-11-22 14:27:01	ken	but xseen kinda violates freenode's default invisibility
2013-11-22 14:27:08	ken	i do not like the idea of xseen
2013-11-22 14:27:19	dean	hmm.
2013-11-22 14:27:21	dean	good point.
2013-11-22 14:27:27	ken	i like being able to talk to people in some channels without necessarily disclosing to other channels that i am currently online
2013-11-22 14:27:32	dean	!xseen should, if anything, only tell you the timestamp. not channel or message.
2013-11-22 14:27:32	lance	dean: xseen should.
2013-11-22 14:27:43	sean	Heh.
2013-11-22 14:27:45	dean	lance: wat?
2013-11-22 14:27:45	lance	dean: I think... Yes.
2013-11-22 14:27:52	dean	oh.
2013-11-22 14:28:03	ken	sean: ??
2013-11-22 14:28:03	dean	the or plugin runs even without a ? on the end for some reason.
2013-11-22 14:28:15	sean	ken: !?
2013-11-22 14:28:31	sean	lance: oranges or apples
2013-11-22 14:28:31	lance	sean: apples.
2013-11-22 14:30:05	dean	it's kind of amusing to watch the logs and see into channel i'm not in.
2013-11-22 14:30:26	dean	(it's just crypto419)
2013-11-22 14:30:38	dean	which is a little ironic, considering... cryptography, privacy.
2013-11-22 14:30:44	ken	yup
2013-11-22 14:30:51	ken	we trust you, which is why we use your lance, though
2013-11-22 14:31:25	dean	well shucks.
2013-11-22 14:32:05	dean	but yeah. lance is now really easy to set up, if you trust heroku.
2013-11-22 14:32:42	emily	ken: have people in crypto419 seen http://irssi-otr.tuxfamily.org/ ?
2013-11-22 14:33:04	ken	no, haven't yet
2013-11-22 14:33:16	dean	emily: using otr would prevent lance from being helpful in the channel, which would defeat the purpose of having lance there.

2013-11-22 14:35:03	sean	Oh, I forgot to mention: preflex *can* be told to exclude channels from xseen, IIRC.
2013-11-22 14:35:44	emily	is it pre-flex? or pref-lex?
2013-11-22 14:35:52	sean	Dunno.
2013-11-22 14:36:00	sean	I always assumed the former.

2013-11-22 15:31:08	dean	emily: yes?
2013-11-22 15:31:29	emily	speaking of unicode
2013-11-22 15:31:52	dean	yeah... don't do that then.
2013-11-22 15:32:07	emily	heh
2013-11-22 15:56:37	emily	sean: dean: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/3656002 thoughts on hasPermission?
2013-11-22 16:30:34	dean	emily: commandChannelPerm doesn't exist yet?
2013-11-22 16:31:01	dean	oh. most of this isn't working yet.
2013-11-22 16:31:04	emily	lots of those functions don't exist
2013-11-22 16:31:22	emily	yeah, just stubbing out the general behavior before I invest a lot of time and write tests
2013-11-22 16:31:29	dean	problem:
2013-11-22 16:31:50	dean	if you are in a group that has a permission, but you are explicitly blacklisted, this would still allow you.
2013-11-22 16:32:22	dean	i would do it... differently. I'll write something up at another time though. if you can get yours working, it seems fine (minus the bug I mentioned)
2013-11-22 16:32:52	dean	maybe instead do: if self.groupIsRestricted(users_group,thing) or self.userIsRestricted(user, thing): return False as one of the early steps?
2013-11-22 16:33:03	emily	thats what I was thinking
2013-11-22 16:33:10	emily	dean: how would you do it differently?
2013-11-22 16:33:47	dean	build a mapping of groups and users, (not sure which direction).
2013-11-22 16:34:16	dean	then walk down the list of permissions "Does the user match this selector?" -> "Does this group have the permission I'm looking for?" -> add one to the good list.
2013-11-22 16:34:26	dean	"Does it have the negation of the selector?" -> return False
2013-11-22 16:34:32	dean	if the good list is positive, return True
2013-11-22 16:35:06	dean	i guess the major difference is that i wouldn't seperate group checking and user checking and channel checking.
2013-11-22 16:35:08	emily	hmm, I feel like I might end up writing that functionality when I write the function stubs...
2013-11-22 16:35:14	dean	it would just be one big 'matches selector'
2013-11-22 16:35:48	dean	and then something like '@admin' or 'emily#channel' would just be selectors that would either match or not match a comm object.
2013-11-22 16:36:34	emily	okay, but how would 'emily#channel' match positive to @everybody?
2013-11-22 16:36:56	dean	special case: the selector @everyone (or '*') would always match.
2013-11-22 16:37:03	emily	or 'emily#channel' to '#channe;'
2013-11-22 16:37:09	emily	*'#channel'
2013-11-22 16:37:10	dean	i think, after some reflection, that I like '*' better than '@everyone'
2013-11-22 16:37:42	dean	so, 'emily#channel' is -> comm['user'] == emily and comm['channel'] = '#channel'
2013-11-22 16:37:47	dean	because the matcher understands #
2013-11-22 16:37:56	dean	kind of like css selectors and: div#id.class
2013-11-22 16:39:54	emily	I still feel like you would have to implement some precedence logic with that strategy, right?
2013-11-22 16:40:09	dean	i don't think so.
2013-11-22 16:40:15	dean	or rather, yes.
2013-11-22 16:40:23	dean	the precedence is that negatives overrule positives, and that is it.
2013-11-22 16:40:30	dean	you don't return until you have looked at every rule.
2013-11-22 16:40:49	dean	it's   any(positives) and not any(negatives)
2013-11-22 16:41:06	emily	but what if you are in a group that isn't allowed to do something, but the user is explicitly allowed?
2013-11-22 16:41:26	dean	hmm.
2013-11-22 16:41:29	dean	i hadn't thought about that.
2013-11-22 16:41:31	emily	wow, permissions are complicated
2013-11-22 16:41:47	emily	man, fuck this, lets just use ldap or something
2013-11-22 16:42:00	dean	fuck ldap in the ear.
2013-11-22 16:42:13	emily	there *has* to be a lib that implements group logic like this
2013-11-22 16:42:37	dean	ok, here is my suggestion: in the group- user+ situation you just said: the user doesn't have permission.
2013-11-22 16:42:52	dean	there are other ways to express that.
2013-11-22 16:42:59	dean	because permissions are a whitelist only.
2013-11-22 16:43:07	dean	just don't mention the permission in the group.
2013-11-22 16:43:11	dean	or if you need it, figure out a better way.
2013-11-22 16:54:52	emily	dean: how do you run tests?
2013-11-22 16:55:09	dean	emily: 'trial lance'
2013-11-22 16:55:13	dean	there are not many.
2013-11-22 16:55:17	dean	if you write them, yay.

2013-11-22 23:06:48	dean	jen: are you familiar with virtualenv?
2013-11-22 23:07:04	dean	also, why did you use python3?
2013-11-22 23:07:15	kenzy	She's using virtual env
2013-11-22 23:07:28	dean	kenzy: ok, well, she needs to install the dependencies.
2013-11-22 23:07:33	jen	yes, and I tried using python 2 as well and it still didn't work
2013-11-22 23:07:38	dean	from inside the virtualenv, pip install -r requirements.txt
2013-11-22 23:07:41	kenzy	did it
2013-11-22 23:07:44	dean	jen: python3 is not supported.
2013-11-22 23:07:45	kenzy	we read the readme
2013-11-22 23:07:53	jen	and ran it using python 2
2013-11-22 23:07:57	jen	same error :/
2013-11-22 23:08:08	dean	did you activate the virtualenv?
2013-11-22 23:08:14	kenzy	yes
2013-11-22 23:08:18	dean	what is the output of  which python  ?
2013-11-22 23:08:43	dean	what is the output of  pip freeze  ?
2013-11-22 23:08:43	jen	/home/lucy/lance/bin/python

2013-11-22 23:08:58	jen	wsgiref==0.1.2
2013-11-22 23:09:08	dean	so you did not install the requirements.
2013-11-22 23:09:20	dean	did you install the requirements before or after setting up the virtualenv?
2013-11-22 23:09:28	jen	after
2013-11-22 23:09:36	dean	well, you don't have them.
2013-11-22 23:09:47	justin	jen: can you pastebin the output of 'pip freeze'
2013-11-22 23:09:53	justin	(without quotes)
2013-11-22 23:09:57	dean	justin: she already did.
2013-11-22 23:09:59	dean	above.
2013-11-22 23:10:08	justin	oops, thanks
2013-11-22 23:10:39	dean	jen: make sure your virtualenv is activated. if it is, your shell prompt will say (lance) in it. then run  'pip install requirements.txt'  do not use sudo. pastebin the output of that.
2013-11-22 23:11:08	justin	pip install -r requirements.txt
2013-11-22 23:11:10	jen	ok, pip install -r requirements.txt produces error: pg_config executable not found
2013-11-22 23:11:13	dean	er, right.
2013-11-22 23:11:28	dean	well that would be a problem.
2013-11-22 23:11:40	dean	hrm. i know what is wrong. i'm trying to figure out how best to deal with it...
2013-11-22 23:11:47	justin	nuke the venv and recreate?
2013-11-22 23:11:50	dean	no
2013-11-22 23:12:03	dean	the short of it is that psychopg2 is in requirements.txt, because it is needed for productions.
2013-11-22 23:12:07	jen	it seems to be a problem with psycopg2
2013-11-22 23:12:08	kenzy	what id pg_config anyways?
2013-11-22 23:12:16	dean	jen: you need to install the client libs for postgresql.
2013-11-22 23:12:30	dean	pg_config and psycopg2 are for postgresql.
2013-11-22 23:12:43	justin	dean: client libs or client dev libs?
2013-11-22 23:12:44	dean	you don't need postgresql, but that is the work around for the moment.
2013-11-22 23:13:00	dean	justin: i don't know. I don't use a distro that makes distiguishes that.
2013-11-22 23:13:21	dean	jen: or, as a very temporary work around, open requirements.txt, remove psychopg2, and then install the deps.
2013-11-22 23:13:21	jen	ok, so I'm installing postgresql?
2013-11-22 23:13:24	justin	yeah, that's why i asked (i usually don't either, but at work it's gotten me before0
2013-11-22 23:13:27	dean	the client stuff, yeah.

2013-11-22 23:56:30	jen	should I just remove that from the setup?
2013-11-22 23:57:11	dean	no.
2013-11-22 23:57:16	dean	it is needed for other things.

2013-11-24 21:00:19	dean	emily: btw, i used json out of habit in that comment i made, but we should probably either a) use yaml, or b) turn the rest of the code to use json instead of yaml.
2013-11-24 21:00:35	emily	okay
2013-11-24 21:00:45	emily	this acl thing I wrote is very non-complete
2013-11-24 21:00:53	dean	yeah, i saw a lot of stubs.
2013-11-24 21:01:01	emily	actually, i ripped that out

2013-11-24 21:15:55	emily	dean: where do you think we should put an ACL object? in the bot?
2013-11-24 21:15:59	emily	in the comm?
2013-11-24 21:16:43	dean	not in the comm.
2013-11-24 21:16:51	emily	it needs a config passed to it
2013-11-24 21:16:54	dean	the ACL object is a pretty permanent thing, it's like the config.
2013-11-24 21:16:59	emily	yeah
2013-11-24 21:17:06	dean	i think on the protocol, the bot, makes sense.

2013-11-24 21:51:46	emily	I cleaned things up
2013-11-24 21:51:50	emily	good catch
2013-11-24 21:52:06	dean	ah
2013-11-24 22:00:27	emily	dean: is reactor.stop() an acceptable way to make lance stop? I can't find code that does something like this that is already in lance
2013-11-24 22:00:40	dean	i think so.
2013-11-24 22:00:50	dean	you could also sys.exit(), but that might be a bit rude.
2013-11-24 22:01:11	emily	I don't believe in sys.exit() outside of main()
2013-11-24 22:01:28	dean	+1
2013-11-24 22:03:44	emily	I left the acl implementation very unfinished in the hopes of one day having a more useful system written
2013-11-24 22:04:04	emily	so we are on the same page :)
2013-11-24 22:04:23	emily	okay, should I rebase everything into one commit? or do you want the cleanup history on master?
2013-11-24 22:19:58	dean	either is fine.
2013-11-24 22:20:26	emily	I think its ready to be merged then.
2013-11-24 22:20:35	dean	cool.
2013-11-24 22:20:49	emily	I have one more plugin to port from hackabot and a score database to convert
2013-11-24 22:21:00	emily	then I think lance is ready for the role of wesley

2013-11-25 11:28:51	dean	i think sean is implying that by giving him commit access, i have made him care, and feel obligated to work on it.

2013-11-25 14:26:34	dean	there are a bunch that are "ken" instead of "!ken"
2013-11-25 14:26:38	ken	ohh ok

2013-11-25 14:28:41	dean	i think learn strips spaces anyways.
2013-11-25 14:28:54	ken	mm, probably
2013-11-25 14:29:34	dean	well, i would update it, but I can't figure out psql's syntax for update.
2013-11-25 14:29:37	dean	and i should do real work.
2013-11-25 14:29:44	ken	indeed, work is important.
2013-11-25 16:02:54	ian	dean: Philosophical question.
2013-11-25 16:03:05	ian	I am writing my bot to search for methods attached to addons
2013-11-25 16:03:08	dean	*blink*
2013-11-25 16:03:17	dean	what do you mean "addons" ?
2013-11-25 16:03:31	ian	Like sed
2013-11-25 16:03:40	dean	oh, i misparsed, sorry. carry on.
2013-11-25 16:03:54	ian	I plan to support methods "onKick," "onMeKick," and "onMeKicked"
2013-11-25 16:04:10	ian	And likewise "onPart," and "onMePart"
2013-11-25 16:04:19	dean	sure
2013-11-25 16:04:25	ian	Like special methods if they involve the bot specifically
2013-11-25 16:04:53	dean	event listeners.
2013-11-25 16:04:58	ian	Should I make it so that if, for example, the bot parts the channel, that only "onMePart" is called, or should I have it call both methods?
2013-11-25 16:05:17	dean	well, you don't actually see anyone part, so onPArt shouldn't be called.
2013-11-25 16:05:33	ian	What do you mean I do not see anyone part?
2013-11-25 16:06:09	ian	The bot will see parts just as though it were another client.
2013-11-25 16:06:13	dean	you did not observe a user depart the channel.
2013-11-25 16:06:36	dean	or rather, whatever the irc protocol does.
2013-11-25 16:06:52	dean	if the servers say "X user parted the channel", you shouldn't care what X is, and you should tell the addon.
2013-11-25 16:07:01	dean	if the server doesn't say that, you shouldn't simulate events.
2013-11-25 16:07:04	ian	I know...
2013-11-25 16:07:08	dean	unless you want to deviate from the irc protocol.
2013-11-25 16:07:31	dean	which is fine, but i wouldn't want to.
2013-11-25 16:07:37	ian	Except I receive the same part message if I were to part the channel myself as though it were someone else.
2013-11-25 16:07:55	dean	then sure.
2013-11-25 16:07:56	ian	:dean!ident@host PART #lance :msg
2013-11-25 16:08:03	ian	:ian!ident@host PART #lance :msg
2013-11-25 16:08:10	ian	I would see those of we both parted in that order.
2013-11-25 16:08:17	dean	that sounds fine to me.
2013-11-25 16:08:48	ian	I just wonder if I should have "onPart" be called in addition to "onMePart" if the bot itself is parting.
2013-11-25 16:09:05	sean	dean: So would you like for me to produce an object that produces mostly-accurate nick lists in /join'd channels via tracking joins and parts?
2013-11-25 16:09:14	sean	It would be easy and a useful building block, I think.
2013-11-25 16:09:40	dean	sean: this will indeed be a useful thing to have.
2013-11-25 16:09:50	ian	sean: By mostly-accurate, do you mean with exception to +u channels?
2013-11-25 16:09:57	 *	ian has that built into his IRC module.
2013-11-25 16:10:38	sean	ian: With exception to netsplits, as far as external events; additionally, due to race conditions, it's totally possible to *never* know that somebody's in or not in a channel.
2013-11-25 16:10:57	sean	NAMES, as I've said before, is unreliable.
2013-11-25 16:11:02	ian	Oh?
2013-11-25 16:11:10	ian	How so?
2013-11-25 16:11:21	ian	And how about WHO?
2013-11-25 16:12:25	ian	(Actually, I guess I will have "onPart" called in addition to "onMePart"
2013-11-25 16:12:26	ian	)
2013-11-25 16:13:06	sean	Let's use RFC 1459.
2013-11-25 16:13:27	sean	4.2.5 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459.html#section-4.2.5
2013-11-25 16:13:38	sean	NAMES doesn't tell one *which* channel the names are for.
2013-11-25 16:14:23	sean	Additionally, there's no indication if a NAMES issued does *not* correspond to an existing channel.
2013-11-25 16:14:27	dean	sean: in theory, could you deploy a "probe" client that only joins the target channel, and then use NAMES?
2013-11-25 16:14:58	dean	which sounds like something I don't want to do.
2013-11-25 16:15:16	ian	sean: Are you referring to calling /names on a channel you have not joined?
2013-11-25 16:15:26	sean	ian: Calling NAMES on *any* channel.
2013-11-25 16:15:46	dean	ian: the spec says that sending the NAMES message to the server does not respect any channel.
2013-11-25 16:15:48	sean	dean: You'd still have the problem of figuring out which channel you called NAMES for.
2013-11-25 16:16:15	dean	sean: if you have one channel per client, that shouldn't be a problem?
2013-11-25 16:16:20	ian	:perseus.insomniairc.net 353 melissa = #chat :+S[a]nna +Jalba +Typherix +MaraJade jesterpm &@Justin +jokloxtarq +manatee +SexyBear69 &@melissa +Brandon[Offline] &@Data +jonbo_ +Bottswana +n3rd +chaos +Jordan +jonbo +Odysimus
2013-11-25 16:16:35	sean	dean: Mm.
2013-11-25 16:16:45	ian	Why would I not be able to tell that this /names reply was referring to #chat?
2013-11-25 16:18:32	 *	sean rereads Twisted archives
2013-11-25 16:18:41	sean	There was definitely a reason. Maybe not all ircds do it?
2013-11-25 16:18:48	ian	Odd.
2013-11-25 16:19:04	ian	I have not encountered an IRCd that does not yet.
2013-11-25 16:20:15	sean	http://www.mail-archive.com/twisted-python@twistedmatrix.com/msg07167.html
2013-11-25 16:20:40	sean	mithrandir outlines the problem here; I mentioned it above, and the RFC hints at it.
2013-11-25 16:20:46	ian	Although I have run into two different JOIN event syntaxes: ":nick!user@host JOIN #channel" and ":nick!user@host JOIN :#channel"
2013-11-25 16:21:21	sean	So what happens when you send a NAMES for a channel that does not exist and is not registered?
2013-11-25 16:23:39	ian	:perseus.insomniairc.net 401 melissa #adsf :No such nick/channel
2013-11-25 16:23:48	ian	At least on my network
2013-11-25 16:24:00	sean	As does Freenode. However, that message is *not* standard.
2013-11-25 16:24:15	ian	On Freenode, actually, I just get an empty reply.
2013-11-25 16:24:24	ian	And by empty reply, I mean I just get End of /names.
2013-11-25 16:24:36	sean	Rereading the thread, it wouldn't be bad to have this functionality as a clipon. twisted.words.im does this already; we could easily simplify alec's code to behave correctly.
2013-11-25 16:24:49	sean	I'll look into this.
2013-11-25 16:25:04	sean	The other thing is that, if you want a useful user list, you *must* include JOIN and PART information as updates to the list.
2013-11-25 16:25:30	sean	Because issuing NAMES often is not a good idea, and on a big channel (#haskell, #python, #ubuntu) the list is usually stale by the time you get it!
2013-11-25 16:25:45	ian	lol
2013-11-25 16:25:47	ian	with channel.lock:
2013-11-25 16:25:50	ian	Pardon the pun.
2013-11-25 16:25:58	ian	I already do that.
2013-11-25 16:26:29	ian	I use join, part, kick, and quit events to update user lists.
2013-11-25 16:26:43	sean	Which is good.
2013-11-25 16:27:08	ian	When you say stale, you mean by the time I get the entire list, someone could part or join or quit or be kicked?
2013-11-25 16:28:12	sean	Correct.
2013-11-25 16:28:28	sean	And if you look at the rate of change on, say, #python, it's not unreasonable.
2013-11-25 16:28:45	ian	But wouldn't I also see said pjkq events?
2013-11-25 16:41:09	sean	Not interspersed with the NAMES reply lines, no.
2013-11-25 16:41:19	sean	...Unless I missed something about how the list can be split up.
2013-11-25 16:47:32	ian	I would assume that I would just receive pjkq immediately after the names reply, if the IRCd developer was smart enough.
2013-11-25 16:48:04	ian	At least, I think that should be possible.
2013-11-25 16:48:23	dean	i've learned not to rely on the smartness of other devolopers...
2013-11-25 16:48:34	ian	Which is why I like to reinvent the wheel, lol.
2013-11-25 16:48:35	emily	haha
2013-11-25 16:48:46	dean	oh i use other's code, that's easy.

2013-11-25 16:49:02	dean	i just don't rely on 'if the developer of this server was smart'

2013-11-25 16:53:29	emily	heh
2013-11-25 16:53:32	dean	and then migrate the data.

2013-11-26 08:54:35	dean	i guess you can just go through every channel and remove them.
2013-11-26 08:54:50	dean	because quit involves leaving all channels.

2013-11-26 11:12:51	sean	dean: Over the weekend, I intend to implement a package "betterpath", which has improved versions of FilePath from Twisted, without the Twisted dependency. Also things like MemoryPath and UnionPath.
2013-11-26 11:13:05	emily	so that url shortener needs to be modified
2013-11-26 11:13:06	dean	ah. neat.
2013-11-26 11:13:19	dean	emily: howso?
2013-11-26 11:13:30	emily	its shortening things that do not need to be shortened
2013-11-26 11:13:42	dean	it's threshold is probably to small.
2013-11-26 11:14:09	emily	my version of lance is diverging a lot from upstream
2013-11-26 11:14:14	dean	yeah, we need to merge.

2013-11-27 13:05:15	emily	all sorts of bad things
2013-11-27 13:05:18	emily	no its not crashing
2013-11-27 13:05:32	emily	database issues mostly
2013-11-27 13:05:36	sean	Hm.
2013-11-27 13:05:51	emily	people say unicode things and seen logs it, which breaks the db
2013-11-27 13:06:06	emily	and when people teach unicode things it also breaks the db
2013-11-27 13:06:39	emily	then factoid breaks when it tries to lookup whether or not it needs to fire a factoid trigger
2013-11-27 13:06:49	sean	Why isn't the DB using a Unicode-capable column?
2013-11-27 13:06:58	emily	sqlite
2013-11-27 13:07:14	emily	you think switching to postgres will fix things?
2013-11-27 13:07:44	sean	Shouldn't matter. I store Unicode data in SQLite all the time without problems.
2013-11-27 13:07:52	emily	yeah, that wouldn't make sense

2013-11-27 13:12:56	sean	SQLA is refusing to attempt automatic decoding, basically.

2013-11-27 13:14:59	emily	there has to be a setting somewhere
2013-11-27 13:16:28	sean	I think that you'd be better off improving Unicode hygiene in the affected plugins.
2013-11-27 13:16:52	emily	this will affect all plugins that use the database...
2013-11-27 13:16:57	sean	It's undecideable whether a str should be a unicode, and there's strs that have multiple valid decodings.
2013-11-27 13:17:09	sean	So if one wants to .decode("utf8"), they should do it.
2013-11-27 13:17:30	emily	thats unacceptable if every plugin has to do this...
2013-11-27 13:18:16	sean	Well, you can't get around the realities of IRC; incoming data is bytes. It *might* be valid UTF-8.
2013-11-27 13:18:30	sean	And if you want to attempt to decode it prior to passing it to the plugin, then that'd help.
2013-11-27 13:21:36	emily	I'm still not understanding why SQLAlchemy is having issues. Is it getting angry that I'm passing it non-unicode strings?
2013-11-27 13:22:39	sean	Yeah. You're passing strs where it would like unicodes, and it's not naive enough to do that decoding implicitly.
2013-11-27 13:24:31	emily	uhg, okay

2013-11-27 13:35:50	sean	SGTM, although I think it would be useful if the "comm" data mapping came with some docs on the types of the things contained within. I've *really* enjoyed how Haskell doesn't fuck around with Text, Strings, and ByteStrings, and refuses to permit implicit conversions between them.

2013-11-27 17:51:13	dean	it's on my list.
2013-11-27 17:53:49	 *	dean was on a plane most of today.
2013-11-27 18:18:15	emily	dean: I actually worked up a patch that works
2013-11-27 18:18:25	emily	unicode was also breaking seen
2013-11-27 18:18:28	emily	and karma
2013-11-27 18:19:39	dean	emily: yeah. i was working on replacing all the 'strings' with u'strings'
2013-11-27 18:19:54	dean	but got interrupted, and haven't finished.
2013-11-27 18:20:17	emily	i don't know if that would actually fix it
2013-11-27 18:28:33	dean	i'm also taking the advantage to firm things up in the unicode department.
2013-11-27 18:28:44	dean	all communication would be unicode capable.
2013-11-27 18:28:56	dean	and the core would make sure it gets encoded and decoded properly.
2013-11-27 18:31:32	emily	the problem that I ran into was that some things coerced things to acii strings, like regex matching.
2013-11-27 18:32:13	dean	right.
2013-11-27 18:32:20	dean	so i was going to try and stop all that.
2013-11-27 18:33:51	emily	dean: checkout the most recent commit on my master. I got it things working, but its not pretty. I at least found all the pain spots...
2013-11-27 18:34:08	dean	ok
2013-11-27 18:35:00	emily	it sucks when your production version starts dying :(
2013-11-27 18:36:20	dean	indeed.
2013-11-27 18:36:32	emily	ideally, the Unicode conversions would me transparent, like you are saying.
2013-11-27 18:37:27	dean	but i think that requires that all data going in to plugins be unicode.
2013-11-27 18:37:41	dean	ie, unicode objects instead of str.
2013-11-27 18:38:04	emily	what about after an re match. does it remain Unicode?
2013-11-27 18:38:46	dean	i don't know.
2013-11-27 18:38:56	dean	...kind of tempted to switch to python3
2013-11-27 18:39:07	emily	man...
2013-11-27 18:39:08	dean	but I don't know about Twisted.
2013-11-27 18:39:14	emily	lets do iylt
2013-11-27 18:39:21	dean	iylt?
2013-11-27 18:39:24	emily	*do it
2013-11-27 18:39:28	dean	mm

2013-11-27 18:39:58	dean	i see.
2013-11-27 18:40:09	dean	I think that links says no twisted on python3
2013-11-27 18:40:24	emily	shitty
2013-11-27 18:40:28	dean	sean: if you are around, am I wrong about python3 on twisted? in particular, I don't think it works.
2013-11-27 18:41:20	emily	Simpson: if its not py3 compatible, how much can we pay you to port it? :)
2013-11-27 18:41:36	dean	s/(python3) on (twisted)/\2 on \1/
2013-11-27 18:41:36	lance	dean actually meant: sean: if you are around, am I wrong about twisted on python3? in particular, I don't think it works.
2013-11-27 18:41:44	dean	emily: lol.
2013-11-27 18:42:09	dean	emily: the internet makes me think that subsets of twisted work, and that it might make sense to just do it.
2013-11-27 18:42:16	dean	if twisted irc is broken, patch it.
2013-11-27 18:42:18	dean	submit patches.
2013-11-27 18:42:49	emily	sounds like a worthwhile effort.
2013-11-27 18:43:39	dean	indeed.
2013-11-27 18:44:11	dean	next question: should this be seen as an opportunity to make lance better?
2013-11-27 18:44:20	dean	better testable, better architected, etc.
2013-11-27 18:44:44	emily	nah
2013-11-27 18:45:17	emily	its pretty functional right now
2013-11-27 18:45:33	dean	one thing that is slightly troublesome is that the plugins are all syncronous.
2013-11-27 18:45:58	dean	i played with making them async before, by passing around deferreds. it worked alright, actually.
2013-11-27 18:45:58	emily	how is that bad?
2013-11-27 18:46:14	emily	oh
2013-11-27 18:46:15	dean	for example, your timez thing.
2013-11-27 18:46:37	emily	people can just used defffereds
2013-11-27 18:47:12	emily	when they need them.
2013-11-27 18:47:44	dean	yeah. i'd like to add optional support for that.
2013-11-27 18:47:49	dean	later.
2013-11-27 18:47:53	dean	that isn't blocking anything else.
2013-11-27 18:48:32	dean	so it seems like you just wrapped lots of stuff in ude and uen as needed. Is that it?
2013-11-27 18:48:41	dean	that would be fine, if thats all that is needed.
2013-11-27 18:48:44	emily	yep
2013-11-27 18:49:19	emily	its kind of ugly, but it got the job done.
2013-11-27 18:49:37	emily	py3 would be ideal
2013-11-27 18:49:44	emily	thoigh
2013-11-27 18:49:53	emily	*though
2013-11-27 18:49:59	dean	having support for both would be great, but i don't know if that is possible.
2013-11-27 18:50:03	dean	or worth it.
2013-11-27 18:50:12	dean	the place you are running wesley, is it python3 friendly?
2013-11-27 18:50:24	emily	it can be
2013-11-27 18:50:34	dean	ok
2013-11-27 18:50:35	emily	if its not right now
2013-11-27 18:50:47	dean	i know that some mozilla places are very unfriendly to other python versions.
2013-11-27 18:50:55	dean	which is why SUMO is still on python2.6
2013-11-27 18:51:06	emily	its a vps somewhere
2013-11-27 18:51:36	emily	I feel your pain on the 2.6 bs. lol
2013-11-27 18:52:42	dean	http://khanaas.com/kirk/RHEL
2013-11-27 18:53:41	emily	i cant open that link, but I know what it is, and it made me laugh.
2013-11-27 18:54:19	dean	i didn't open it either. I just typed it in.
2013-11-27 18:54:35	dean	I love khanaas and iome.me, because I can just type the urls without a browser.
2013-11-27 18:55:09	emily	that's a whole new level of internet nerdiness
2013-11-27 18:59:26	emily	how would you like to merge my changes upstream? are you not going to support seen and Unicode karma/factoid until we do py3?
2013-11-27 19:00:33	dean	if you have figured it out (which it seems like you have), then I'm fine merging it now.
2013-11-27 19:00:41	dean	my slow merging is mainly due to being slow, not any code problems.
2013-11-27 19:01:33	emily	well, il open a pr when i get the alec, am r? is always good
2013-11-27 19:01:38	dean	test

2013-11-27 19:01:46	lance	emily actually meant: well, il open a pr when i get the alec, an r? is always good
2013-11-27 19:01:53	dean	ok, so unicode nicks aren't allowed. good to know.
2013-11-27 19:02:01	emily	heh
2013-11-27 19:02:14	dean	I tried to add a delta (δ) after my nick.
2013-11-27 19:02:28	emily	I figured irc daemons would not allow nicks or channels to be unicode
2013-11-27 19:02:29	sean	dean: Most of the core works!
2013-11-27 19:02:41	sean	emily: Non-jokingly? Six figures.
2013-11-27 19:03:18	emily	Simpson: okay. does it mater which currency?
2013-11-27 19:03:20	dean	sean: do you think we are going to see python3 support in twisted in the forseeable future?
2013-11-27 19:03:47	dean	and by that I mean, is Twisted going to convert to python3 fast enough to be relavent.
2013-11-27 19:04:57	sean	dean: Yeah. Modules are being ported constantly, and most of twisted.internet is ported.
2013-11-27 19:05:05	dean	ah, ok.
2013-11-27 19:08:49	dean	do you happen to know the status of the parts lance would need? :3
2013-11-27 19:09:05	sean	Uh, twisted.words is pretty unported ATM.
2013-11-27 19:10:06	dean	:c
2013-11-27 19:10:27	 *	dean rewrites lance in node.js
2013-11-27 19:10:29	dean	calls it trashbin.
2013-11-27 19:11:15	emily	lol
2013-11-27 19:13:11	emily	sean: is it actually 6 figures worth of work to port it?
2013-11-27 19:29:44	sean	emily: No, but it's a full-time job for tomprince, who's currently doing lots of Twisted work with some funding.

2013-11-30 16:28:17	melissa	If Freenode had BotServ, that functionality would already be there.
2013-11-30 16:59:35	dean	justin: i think that instead of a whitelist in config, you should make it tie into the new permissions model we are making.
2013-11-30 17:00:14	dean	so you would check for something like the giver has "op.give" and the receiver has "op.receive", or something.
2013-11-30 17:00:35	dean	which would require I finish the permissions model.

2013-12-02 10:22:48	dean	so, it would be cool to load plugins from outside of lance, right?
2013-12-02 10:23:34	dean	what do you think about this: if your config says you want to load the plugin "foo/bar", it would import foo, and then look for a plugin named bar in there?
2013-12-02 10:23:54	dean	like, right now it looks for all plugins in lance/plugins, we could make it look in other modules.
2013-12-02 10:52:48	dean	emily: I notice that wesley in #it is a lance instance. :) nice job
2013-12-02 10:55:46	emily	yep!

2013-12-02 13:20:46	emily	uhh
2013-12-02 13:20:49	emily	dean: yeah, we could do that
2013-12-02 13:21:11	emily	how would that help us with just pip installing and having the plugin discoverable
2013-12-02 13:21:23	emily	the user would have to know which dir the plugin was installed in?
2013-12-02 13:22:12	dean	it would be something like 'pip install mozit' and then in your config you add 'mozit/chiefdeploy' to your plugin list.
2013-12-02 13:22:28	dean	and as long as pip installed mozit to somewhere on your python path, it should work.
2013-12-02 13:22:28	emily	I see
2013-12-02 13:22:54	emily	why not do the opposite direction? make lance go out and look for mozit if it sees mozit/chiefdeploy
2013-12-02 13:22:56	emily	?
2013-12-02 13:23:11	dean	like... lance triggers a pip install?
2013-12-02 13:23:27	emily	yeah, that the user has to [Y/n]
2013-12-02 13:24:00	dean	what if I want to use the mozit version from https://github.com/dean/mozit/my-experimental-branch.git ?
2013-12-02 13:24:11	emily	hmm
2013-12-02 13:24:27	emily	maybe the default is pip
2013-12-02 13:24:41	dean	i guess it could be both ways.
2013-12-02 13:24:42	emily	actually, this is a lot like go's module system
2013-12-02 13:24:58	emily	it looks locally if just mozit/chiefdeploy
2013-12-02 13:25:11	emily	if it sees: pip://mozit/chiefdeploy it does pip
2013-12-02 13:25:16	dean	if you find it in the python path, use it. if not, ask if it should be installed with a basic pip command. if the user doesn't like that, they can install it manually.
2013-12-02 13:25:19	emily	if it sees: https://github.com/dean/mozit/my-experimental-branch.git it does git
2013-12-02 13:25:36	dean	i'd rather not make a package manager.
2013-12-02 13:25:40	dean	pip can already install from git.
2013-12-02 13:26:03	dean	why don't you like the idea of having to pip install something before you can use a plugin?
2013-12-02 13:26:51	emily	right now I have to install a file and update a config. If we are going to upgrade the plugin system lets at least cut down the work-flow to one step
2013-12-02 13:27:55	dean	hmm
2013-12-02 13:28:03	dean	i'll do the first part. pulling things from elsewhere in the path.
2013-12-02 13:28:08	emily	and I don't know if I agree with the sentiment that we are writing a package manager, we are just doing 3 clauses in some if statements
2013-12-02 13:28:11	dean	if you want to do the second part, the auto installation.
2013-12-02 13:28:17	emily	okay
2013-12-02 13:28:31	emily	just keep in mind we might want to do that eventually when you write the first part
2013-12-02 13:28:39	dean	also, for my uses (running on heroku), interactive prompts during start are not good.
2013-12-02 13:28:42	dean	sure.
2013-12-02 13:28:52	emily	there is always --yes :)

2013-12-03 13:52:46	dean	however, with travis based deploys, the downtime is minimal because it builds the app, then takes down the old one, then brings up the new one.
2013-12-03 13:52:58	dean	the lag you see is just because it takes a long time for lance to connect to freenode.
2013-12-03 13:54:25	dean	for webapps there is the idea of doing the upgrade one by one, but I don't think heroku (or paas) does that.
2013-12-03 13:56:45	dean	however, even SUMO does this.
2013-12-03 13:57:04	dean	we bring in the new code, then graceful restart apache.
2013-12-03 13:57:17	dean	there is a time during which the app can't serve requests. thankfully zeus buffers that for us.

2013-12-03 21:52:30	ken	hey so i was thinking about rot13 behavior
2013-12-03 21:52:47	ken	"do what i mean" for flipped normal text is to flip, rot, flip
2013-12-03 21:52:58	ken	and it can't just be ascii value + 13 unconditionally
2013-12-03 21:53:43	justin	oh, what about flip and if ascii, do the rot like you say, else, \u####+13
2013-12-03 21:53:44	ken	otherwise the capital letters at the second half of the alphabet would end up lowercased
2013-12-03 21:53:45	justin	?
2013-12-03 21:53:54	ken	more or less
2013-12-03 21:53:56	justin	well, smart rot, but yes
2013-12-03 21:54:23	justin	ken: open the bug, i'll work on it when I get some free time this week :)
2013-12-03 21:54:57	justin	goahead and asign it to me too

2013-12-04 08:30:59	sean	emily: Buildbot community is close to the Twisted community. I also know warner.
2013-12-04 08:31:25	emily	neat
2013-12-04 08:32:04	emily	lance: learn that /win triggers <say> winning!
2013-12-04 08:32:04	lance	OK, emily
2013-12-04 08:33:44	dean	so i think i'm going to rewrite learn. right now it pretty much does db queries to find it's replies.
2013-12-04 08:34:02	dean	but i don't think i'm good enough at sql to do what I want like that.
2013-12-04 08:34:28	dean	so i'm going to have it all live in memory. when new things are added, it will get pushed to the db and memory, and on load it pulls everything from the db into memory.
2013-12-04 08:34:34	dean	does that sound horrible?
2013-12-04 08:35:02	emily	no
2013-12-04 08:35:23	emily	store it in a datastructure that is easily serialized
2013-12-04 08:35:27	emily	then you should be good
2013-12-04 08:35:48	dean	hmm. then i could avoid database migrations.
2013-12-04 08:35:56	emily	si
2013-12-04 08:36:05	 *	dean ponders stupid things about generic db-backed json storage for pugins.
2013-12-04 08:36:07	dean	*plugins
2013-12-04 08:36:16	emily	store it in a textfield
2013-12-04 08:36:21	emily	json.dumps
2013-12-04 08:36:23	dean	that only supports this model: no querying, just put one/get all
2013-12-04 08:36:47	dean	oh, and delete i guess.
2013-12-04 08:37:30	emily	I think if factoids was flexible enough, we could redo the entire questions module with just factoids
2013-12-04 08:37:51	dean	i'm not sure i want to make factoids that flexible.
2013-12-04 08:38:04	emily	heh
2013-12-04 08:38:10	dean	for one, the parsing of the or questions is pretty complex.
2013-12-04 10:42:51	ken	thoughts on having a stalk plugin for lance, to make it easier to find public stuff that people post under the identities with which they're on irc?
2013-12-04 10:42:57	ken	I dropped a bunch of ideas into https://github.com/dean/lance/issues/48
2013-12-04 10:42:57	lance	ken's shortened url is http://tinyurl.com/leg862h
2013-12-04 10:43:19	dean	ken: sounds hard, and not well suited to be a plugin.
2013-12-04 10:44:25	ken	dean: it's actually really limited in scope
2013-12-04 10:44:35	ken	you use their nick and their account name from whois
2013-12-04 10:44:37	dean	ah, i see now.
2013-12-04 10:44:45	ken	(like for me it'd be james & ken)
2013-12-04 10:44:48	dean	the creepiness to usefulness ratio seems off.
2013-12-04 10:44:57	emily	you would have to hack the notice() code
2013-12-04 10:45:02	emily	which wouldn't be in a plugin
2013-12-04 10:45:09	emily	...I think
2013-12-04 10:45:15	dean	notice?
2013-12-04 10:45:27	emily	its doing a /whois
2013-12-04 10:45:29	emily	right?
2013-12-04 10:45:32	dean	oh.
2013-12-04 10:45:37	ken	yeah, i'm thinking of it more to educate people about what they have out there than... like... actually stalking them?
2013-12-04 10:45:47	emily	I think nickserv content goes to notice()
2013-12-04 10:45:58	ken	kind of like a bigger better more specialized whois
2013-12-04 10:45:58	dean	ken: i'm not going to stop you from writing a plugin :3
2013-12-04 10:46:01	ken	ok
2013-12-04 10:46:36	emily	ken: I you may have to extent core to get the output of /whois to show up in a plugin
2013-12-04 10:46:42	ken	'cause when random new folks show up in the channel and we're confused as to who they are, those are the places to look...
2013-12-04 10:46:46	ken	hmm, ok
2013-12-04 10:46:52	dean	I'd really like it if that extension was done in a not-specific-to-this way.
2013-12-04 10:47:09	emily	ken: you could get their hostmask when they join
2013-12-04 10:47:27	ken	heh, it could just trigger once on join
2013-12-04 10:47:31	ken	nah, that'd be creepy
2013-12-04 10:47:45	ken	"hi newbie, it appears that you're an OSU engineering student with a site online at <link>"
2013-12-04 10:47:51	justin	the entire thing is creepy, might as well
2013-12-04 10:48:12	ken	well !stalk help would contain information on how to get a cloak and generally be more anonymous online
2013-12-04 10:48:19	emily	ken: put a delay in !stalk so it seems like lance is a real person doing the stalking :)
2013-12-04 10:48:24	ken	xD ok
2013-12-04 10:48:25	dean	!help cloak
2013-12-04 10:48:25	lance	Unknown command
2013-12-04 10:48:31	ken	actually that'd be hilarious
2013-12-04 10:48:58	ken	how far would it be ok to take the "lance pretends to be human to troll newbies" stuff?
2013-12-04 10:49:04	justin	random time interval between 5 and 25sec
2013-12-04 10:49:08	ken	or is that more like "not your lance"
2013-12-04 10:49:32	emily	I personally don't see an issue with this plugin
2013-12-04 10:49:52	emily	I don't find it creepy
2013-12-04 10:49:55	ken	yeah, I think if people don't want stuff online they won't put it online
2013-12-04 10:50:08	ken	and it's better for people to know what anyone can find about them than to assume they're anonymous
2013-12-04 10:50:30	emily	ken: you *could* make this optin
2013-12-04 10:50:44	dean	ken: i think it is mainly creepy because you called it !stalk.
2013-12-04 10:50:49	dean	under another name, not so much.

2013-12-04 13:00:55	emily	DEA think that set().add() should except a hash function kwarg, 'key' maybe
2013-12-04 13:00:58	emily	?
2013-12-04 13:01:01	emily	like sorted
2013-12-04 13:03:21	dean	emily: what?
2013-12-04 13:03:32	dean	emily: no.
2013-12-04 13:04:02	dean	python's set uses the built in hash and equal protocols. if you want a different hash function, make an object with custom __hash__ and __eq__ methods.
2013-12-04 13:07:34	emily	I don't really want to do that though
2013-12-04 13:08:19	emily	why can't I just pass __hash__ and __eq__?
2013-12-04 13:10:27	dean	that's not how sets work.
2013-12-04 13:10:45	dean	there is a reason that __hash__ is a standard python interface.
2013-12-04 13:11:06	dean	it should be consistent.
2013-12-04 13:11:18	dean	what if you try and union two sets, one that uses the default hash, and one that uses a special one?
2013-12-04 13:11:25	dean	set_normal | set_weird = ????

2013-12-04 13:23:27	emily	binary set operators hadn't occurred to me though, they would be an issue if you had different hash and comparison functions

2013-12-05 11:36:08	emily	dean: if we moved to py3, why would we use twisted? wouldn't it be more fun to use tulip?
2013-12-05 11:41:35	dean	emily: i don't know what tulip is.
2013-12-05 11:41:42	dean	oh. wait, yes i do
2013-12-05 11:42:06	dean	using tulip would mean quite a few changes. it would basically be a rewrite.
2013-12-05 11:42:15	dean	plus, no one has written tulip.irc, to my knowledge.
2013-12-05 11:42:15	emily	:(
2013-12-05 12:20:57	sean	Tulip is probably going to be unusable. Just a warning.
2013-12-05 12:21:32	emily	uh oh
2013-12-05 12:22:04	sean	> sean doesn't like things that aren't Twisted

2013-12-05 12:22:23	 *	jeff waits impatiently for 11
2013-12-05 12:30:13	dean	sean: why do you think tulip will be unusuable?
2013-12-05 12:30:27	dean	I haven't actually looked to deep into it, except that it adds an event loop to python.
2013-12-05 12:30:34	sean	dean: Because they're having problems expressing basic concurrency concepts, and it's coroutine-based.
2013-12-05 12:31:19	dean	not a fan of coroutines?
2013-12-05 12:31:35	sean	They're slower and harder to read than callbacks.
2013-12-05 12:32:00	sean	(Also "callbacks" is a funny name for "pure computations lifted into the Deferred monad", but that's another story.)
2013-12-05 12:32:17	 *	dean shrugs
2013-12-05 12:32:30	jeff	sean: but teh monads are scary!
2013-12-05 12:33:13	dean	i suspect that callbacks read worse for hello world, but get better once it is (to borrow some JS notation)  doFoo().then(doBar).then(doBaz)

2013-12-07 19:51:46	emily	melissa: enough to hack on an IRC bot, why?
2013-12-07 19:52:09	melissa	The idea is that a scrupulous user would want to try to send a *raw* line "KICK #channel user"
2013-12-07 19:52:28	emily	lance sends things to channels by default
2013-12-07 19:52:28	melissa	Hence the \n
2013-12-07 19:53:00	emily	so when you, melissa, type something like /kick someone
2013-12-07 19:53:19	emily	I think your irc client translates to not '/kick someone' but to KICK #channel someone
2013-12-07 19:53:56	melissa	Yes, but lance does not do that.
2013-12-07 19:54:04	melissa	Presumably
2013-12-07 19:54:09	melissa	As that would be a security issue.
2013-12-07 19:54:09	emily	no, lance does not do that

2013-12-07 19:56:06	melissa	Unless scrubbed properly, !s/.+/\nCMD/ could have caused lance to send CMD to the server instead of CMD as being a private message to the channel.

2013-12-13 11:27:03	emily	I actually don't have an issue with it.
2013-12-13 11:27:11	dean	besides it's open sourcey-ness?

2013-12-30 19:28:30	dean	amber: lance doesn't have a way to isolate plugins into seperate channels.
2013-12-30 19:29:03	dean	that could either be added, or the plugin could have the channel isolation in it.
2013-12-30 19:29:24	dean	also, I have been pondering the ability to import plugins from pip installed packages, which would be cool.
2013-12-30 19:29:55	dean	I imagine mike would be interested in that too, but he isn't around.
2013-12-30 19:31:10	dean	the showing of the hand to people in that screenshot looks pretty sweet. i'm curious how that happened.

2013-12-31 12:02:15	amber	Yeah, I was thinking that channel isolation would be built into that plugin specifically, but isolation available for all plugins would be pretty nice.
2013-12-31 12:03:02	dean	we could probably (ab)use the permissions model for channel isolation.

2014-01-06 10:38:04	ken	and realized those are both your projects
2014-01-06 10:38:28	ken	so umm, is there a time you'd be either around or available to g-hangouts, to tell us what to do on them?
2014-01-06 10:38:31	dean	ken: wok is more your/lug's project than mine.
2014-01-06 10:38:38	dean	but sure.
2014-01-06 10:39:49	dean	Were you thinking during one of the meetings?
2014-01-06 10:39:54	dean	or some other time for planning?
2014-01-06 10:40:51	ken	I was thinking of having a meeting and calling it a hackathon
2014-01-06 10:41:02	ken	and handing out lance plugins and stuff for people who don't know what to hack on
2014-01-06 10:41:10	dean	hmm.
2014-01-06 10:41:21	dean	i'd like to get support for pip install plugins before that.

2014-01-06 10:41:29	lance	dean actually meant: i'd like to get support for pip installed plugins before that.

2014-01-06 11:18:17	alec	so with lance ACL, i see its somewhat regex based?
2014-01-06 11:18:22	alec	okay
2014-01-06 11:18:40	alec	what can i do to reduce chan utils use to me?
2014-01-06 11:18:54	dean	so if you look at factoids.py

2014-01-06 11:19:31	alec	yeah
2014-01-06 11:19:42	dean	the default ACL provider is always allow, so anyone can.
2014-01-06 11:19:57	dean	but if you create an ACL file, then the default becomes deny.
2014-01-06 11:20:03	dean	and you have to be whitelisted in the config.
2014-01-06 11:20:08	-->	jen (wymanl@osuosl/staff/jen) has joined #lance
2014-01-06 11:20:22	dean	it's horribly documented, sorry.
2014-01-06 11:20:41	dean	the permission file is a json document
2014-01-06 11:20:49	alec	okay, well in anycase i see channelutil's there is no ACL in the plugin yet, so i cant use acl with it?
2014-01-06 11:21:04	dean	right. channelutils needs to be modified to have ACLs.
2014-01-06 11:21:06	alec	okay
2014-01-06 11:21:14	alec	is there anyway to just ignore a particular user with lance?
2014-01-06 11:21:21	dean	no.
2014-01-06 11:21:40	alec	im onyl asking because lately ive had a few people ask me to put lance in their channel, and people keep making him leave.
2014-01-06 11:21:40	dean	though the acl system could be (ab)used for that.
2014-01-06 11:21:50	alec	so im just going to disable channelutils now
2014-01-06 11:21:53	dean	people who have access?
2014-01-06 11:22:00	dean	also, the lance instance here? or another?
2014-01-06 11:22:04	alec	another
2014-01-06 11:22:08	dean	k
2014-01-06 11:23:18	alec	thanks for the info
2014-01-06 11:23:20	alec	just wanted to check
2014-01-06 11:23:23	dean	k
2014-01-06 11:25:08	dean	alec: once channelutils has ACL support (I hear lug is going to do a hackathon soon), it would look like this: https://pastebin.mozilla.org/3953059
2014-01-06 11:26:05	alec	just curious, why does it need to be implemented in the plugin
2014-01-06 11:26:07	alec	?
2014-01-06 11:26:16	alec	i feel like ACL should also work at the core level
2014-01-06 11:26:28	alec	so plugin specific stuff, and then like core-level stuff
2014-01-06 11:26:32	alec	should have ACL
2014-01-06 11:26:32	dean	that was discussed. I didn't think it would be fine grained enough.
2014-01-06 11:26:40	alec	but maybe it just isnt done cause time!
2014-01-06 11:26:57	dean	for example, adding quotes should have different ACLs than viewing quotes.
2014-01-06 11:27:10	dean	but only the Quote plugin knows enough to do that, so the quote plugin has to deal with ACLs.
2014-01-06 11:27:18	dean	but there should be some core level ACLs, too.
2014-01-06 11:27:26	dean	like "you need this permission to talk to the bot"
2014-01-06 11:27:26	alec	yeah, makes sense
2014-01-06 11:27:32	alec	tahts what i was thinking ^
2014-01-06 11:28:12	alec	i think plugin-level should still exist. but i also think maybe the base interfaces should have acl methods for post-* pre-* actions
2014-01-06 11:28:22	alec	more like hooks
2014-01-06 11:37:03	dean	huh?
2014-01-06 11:38:26	dean	what do you mean post-* and pre-* actions?
2014-01-06 11:38:28	dean	hooks?
2014-01-06 11:38:33	dean	do you want ACLs to run random code?
2014-01-06 11:41:00	dean	(because that's what "hooks" means to me)
2014-01-06 12:13:01	alec	dean: not random
2014-01-06 12:13:14	dean	s/random/arbitrary/
2014-01-06 12:13:14	lance	alec actually meant: dean: not arbitrary
2014-01-06 12:13:28	alec	more like, each plugin inerhits a set methods related to ACL's that always happen during dispatch and after dispatch or something
2014-01-06 12:14:15	dean	i really don't understand why you would want after.
2014-01-06 12:14:40	alec	just good practice for 'hook' like things to have an after imo
2014-01-06 12:14:53	alec	might have an ACL like, line length < 80
2014-01-06 12:14:59	alec	restrict all outputs less than that
2014-01-06 12:15:07	alec	to prevent regex abuse or something
2014-01-06 12:15:09	dean	right, but we aren't talking about modification hooks.
2014-01-06 12:15:09	alec	ect.
2014-01-06 12:15:13	dean	this isn't a pipeline.
2014-01-06 12:15:45	dean	i think that this limits the power of plugins.
2014-01-06 12:15:55	alec	yeah, kind of.
2014-01-06 12:15:59	dean	ACLs are just that: access control lists.
2014-01-06 12:16:06	dean	controlling who/what has access.
2014-01-06 12:16:57	dean	i don't think that what you are talking about fits in to lance, it would be something that each plugin would implement if it is needed.
2014-01-06 12:17:31	alec	i suppose.
2014-01-06 12:18:07	dean	remember that the base class for plugin just receives every message and may act on it.
2014-01-06 12:18:41	alec	yeah
2014-01-06 12:19:05	dean	it might be nice to have helpers that say "this is a command triggered by !foo and it needs this permission and has these restrictions."
2014-01-06 12:19:11	dean	but those are all helper classes on top of the plugins.
2014-01-06 12:19:14	dean	not below them in the core.
2014-01-06 12:20:12	dean	(this should all really be documented)
2014-01-06 12:26:11	alec	lol, yeah.

2014-01-06 19:14:32	justin	dean: yeah
2014-01-06 21:05:54	justin	dean: is there a way for a plugin to get a list of channels that lance is in?
2014-01-06 21:06:18	dean	you could probably look at the list of channels lance *should* be in in the config.
2014-01-06 21:06:47	dean	additionally, you could monitor parts and joins by subclassing the right thing.
2014-01-06 21:07:08	dean	I think that is called a Presence plugin.
2014-01-06 21:07:12	justin	that's what i was going to do (2nd suggestion) if there wasn't already something
2014-01-06 21:07:23	dean	but afaik, there isn't a place where what channels you are in is written down.
2014-01-06 21:07:26	dean	twisted might know.
2014-01-06 21:09:25	emily	the irc server knows
2014-01-06 21:09:36	emily	you could /whois yourself and listen to the notify()
2014-01-06 21:11:06	dean	that sounds like a bad idea.

2014-01-07 07:27:05	emily	justin: I think I broke it
2014-01-07 08:41:47	dean	unicode's hard.
2014-01-07 08:42:54	emily	yar
2014-01-07 08:45:30	dean	justin: you should write tests for remindme. I don't know how to write tests for a timed process in python though.
2014-01-07 08:46:03	emily	two twisteds and IPC!
2014-01-07 08:46:25	emily	and a third twisted to test that.
2014-01-07 08:49:21	dean	quiet you.
2014-01-07 08:49:39	dean	you can run all three from one reactor.

2014-01-07 10:26:00	justin	i'm unsure how to handle the unicode case. twisted really doesn't like it
2014-01-07 10:26:46	dean	justin: emily wrote some help methods. the general approach is that you need to decode and encode things at the right time.
2014-01-07 10:27:19	dean	and I think there is an encode=True kwarg you can pass to bot.reply that helps
2014-01-07 10:27:23	emily	justin: are you using a db?
2014-01-07 10:27:32	justin	yes
2014-01-07 10:27:36	emily	thats where your issue is
2014-01-07 10:27:54	emily	look at the seen plugin
2014-01-07 10:28:19	emily	for examples on how to do unicode with uen() and ude()
2014-01-07 10:29:39	justin	will do, thanks
