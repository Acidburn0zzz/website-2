Welcome to OSU DevOps Bootcamp's documentation!
===============================================
The `OSU Open Source Lab <http://osuosl.org/>`_ provides quality hosting for more than 160
open source projects. Along with delivering over 460 terabytes of open source
data a month, the OSL trains students to be expert systems administrators
and software developers ready to enter industry. The OSL encounters more
demand for qualified students than the employees graduating each year can
supply. We'd like to give back to OSU and the wider open source community by
training interested students from all disciplines in the real-world skills
necessary for success as software developers and systems engineers. To this
end, we'll be offering an extracurricular training program with 2 to 3
sessions per month through the school year, in which current OSL students and
software professionals will teach all of the topics with which one must be
familiar in order to succeed. Although hands-on labs will be offered later in
the program, no initial familiarity with software development or Linux will be
assumed. 

This program is based on the 
`PSU Braindump <http://cat.pdx.edu/thecat/thecat-presents-braindump-orientation.html>`_, 
where for over a decade they have been turning PSU students into sysadmins that have rapidly 
been flowing into the growing number of startups in Portland.  
This program will be dynamically shaping itself based on the feedback we get
from those involved. Below we have an outline for the first four meetings to
give you an idea of where we are going to be starting.
