Intro to Scripting
==================

.. note:: Run an example script from file (example.sh)

    Write a for loop on the command line, ie.
    for file in $(ls)
    do
    echo $file
    done

    Show for loop in a script (forloop.sh)

    Intro to conditionals, etc.

Perl & Python
-------------

* When to use something other than bash?
* Perl â€“ better file I/O regex support
* Python easy to code and popular
* Core system packages use python
* Yum (RPM package manager)
* Portage (Gentoo package manager)
* Installers (anaconda)

.. note:: Perl-
     * Practical Extraction and Report Language
     * You will always in encounter perl as a sysadmin
     * used for many reporting and basic functions
     * very extensible
     * Usually the next step after bash

    Python-
     * interpreted, interactive, object-oriented prog lang
     * Lots of systems have python API bindings for their applications

    Ruby-
     * Good too, but less known or installed by default
     * Think of who will manage after you leave
