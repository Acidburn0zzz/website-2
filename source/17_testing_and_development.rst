Testing and Development
=======================

Why write tests?
----------------

Testing your software ensures that it:

* meets the requirements that guided its design and development,
* responds correctly to all kinds of inputs,
* performs its functions within an acceptable time,
* is sufficiently usable,
* can be installed and run in its intended environments, and
* achieves the general result its stakeholders desire.

Static vs. Dynamic Testing
--------------------------

* Static testing is similar to linting.  It doesn't actually run your code, but walks through it to find inconsistencies and common errors. 
* Static testing involves verification
* Dynamic testing runs your code and tests various inputs and outputs.
* Dynamic testing involves validation.
