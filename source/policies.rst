"The Deal"
==========

You get: 

- Mentorship from students and professionals with advanced skills in software
  development and systems administration
- Professional connections in the software industry
- A welcoming environment to start learning in, if you've always wanted to
  learn about software development and systems administration but never been
  sure where to start
- An opportunity to fill in any gaps in your knowledge, if you're a
  self-taught coder or sysadmin
- The skills to build and deploy open source software, or contribute to
  existing projects

Why we're offering this: 

- The OSL gets a larger pool of candidates to recommend to companies interested 
  in recruiting OSL students
- The OSL gets to work with a wider variety of students, which fits better
  with its new status as part of the school of EECS
- The open source community gets more contributors to its projects

Attendance policy
=================

We will schedule Bootcamp meetings for a time that works for a majority of
attendees. Each meeting's curriculum will build on what you learned the
previous session, so if you miss a meeting, you're responsible for studying
the basics of its content on your own. To facilitate this, we will provide
resources for independent study about each topic that we cover. 

Although Bootcamp leaders will be available at times outside of the regular
meetings to help answer any questions about any of the training program's
content, we will not spend class time reviewing material for those who skipped
a lecture. If you attended a lesson and don't understand something from it,
you're welcome to ask in class, because others very likely have the same
concern. But if you want to make up a class you skipped, it's disrespectful to
those who attended to spend their class time on questions which you could
resolve on your own time.
