Exercises
=========

These exercises will help you get some practice with the tools and skills we
go over at Bootcamp, and also help you get more comfortable with your machine. 
Each exercise will also include both a beginner and a more advanced exercise --
you can do one or both, based on where you're at.  
Feel free to submit issues, pull requests, or comments to them if you 
feel like something is missing, or could be explained better!
