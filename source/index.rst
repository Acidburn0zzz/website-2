    * Since the spring career fair is April 23rd, it's possible that we may be
      displaced from our usual room in favor of industry events on the 24th.

DevOps Bootcamp is an OSU Open Source Lab and OSU Linux Users Group program
aimed at boosting our impact and outreach while shrinking the skills gap for
OSU students interested in DevOps.

The `OSU Open Source Lab <http://osuosl.org/>`_ provides quality hosting for
more than 160 open source projects. Along with delivering over 460 terabytes of
open source data a month, the OSL employs and mentors students to be expert
systems administrators and software developers ready to enter industry. The OSL
encounters more demand for qualified students than the employees graduating
each year can supply. We'd like to give back to OSU and the wider open source
community by training interested students from all disciplines in the
real-world skills necessary for success as software developers and systems
engineers. To this end, we'll be offering an extracurricular training program
with 2 to 3 sessions per month through the school year, in which current OSL
students and software professionals will teach all of the topics with which one
must be familiar in order to succeed. Although hands-on labs will be offered
later in the program, no initial familiarity with software development or Linux
will be assumed.

This program is based on the `PSU Braindump <http://braindump.cat.pdx.edu>`_,
where for 21 years they have been turning PSU students into sysadmins who have
rapidly been flowing into the growing number of startups in Portland.

The DevOps Bootcamp program will be dynamically shaping itself based on the
feedback we get from  interested students.
