What is DevOps?
===============


DevOps (a portmanteau of software development and server operations)
represents the integration between software development and operations
engineering that has become increasingly necessary with the emergence of cloud
computing. In essense, the jobs are no longer mutually exclusive- developers
need more operations-based knowledge in order to understand how their
application will be deployed, test locally and preemptively address potential
security risks, while systems administrators need to know developer-based
materials in order to design infrastructure optimally to fit an application's
needs without wasting capacity and to troubleshoot issues with the
increasingly complex software cycle. Additionally, site reliability
engineering and many modern security roles require a background with a balance
between development and operations. 

Purpose of DevOps BootCamp
==========================

DevOps BootCamp is an OSU Open Source Lab program dedicated to teaching core software 
development and systems operation skills to interested OSU students and community members.
DevOps BootCamp will provide continuity and comprehensive open source education
that’s outside the scope of regular LUG meetings.

"The Deal"
----------

Students get:

* Mentorship from students and professionals with advanced skills in software
  development and systems administration
* Professional connections in the software industry
* A welcoming environment to start learning in, if you've always wanted to
  learn about software development and systems administration but never been sure
  where to start
* An opportunity to fill in any gaps in your knowledge, if you’re a
  self-taught coder or sysadmin
* The skills to build and deploy open source software, or contribute to
  existing projects

Why we’re offering this:

* The OSL gets a larger pool of candidates to recommend to companies
  interested in recruiting students
* The OSL gets to work with a wider variety of students, which fits better
  with its new status as part of the school of EECS
* The open source community gets more contributors to its projects

 
Target Audience
---------------

Our goal is to make the DevOps BootCamp program accessible to students and
community members from all different backgrounds. You have to want to learn, and
be willing to ask questions whenever you don't understand something, and be open
to making time to play with the cool tools/toys which we’ll be teaching you
about.
