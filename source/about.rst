About DevOps BootCamp
=====================

What is DevOps?
---------------

DevOps (a portmanteau of software development and server operations)
represents the integration between software development and operations
engineering that has become increasingly necessary with the emergence of cloud
computing. In essence, the jobs are no longer mutually exclusive- developers
need more operations-based knowledge in order to understand how their
application will be deployed, test locally and preemptively address potential
security risks, while systems administrators need to know developer-based
materials in order to design infrastructure optimally to fit an application's
needs without wasting capacity and to troubleshoot issues with the
increasingly complex software cycle. Additionally, site reliability
engineering and many modern security roles require a background with a balance
between development and operations. 

Purpose of DevOps BootCamp
--------------------------

DevOps BootCamp is an OSU Open Source Lab program dedicated to teaching core software 
development and systems operation skills to interested OSU students and community members.
DevOps BootCamp will provide continuity and comprehensive open source education
that’s outside the scope of regular LUG meetings.

"The Deal"
~~~~~~~~~~

Students get:

* Mentorship from students and professionals with advanced skills in software
  development and systems administration
* Professional connections in the software industry
* A welcoming environment to start learning in, if you've always wanted to
  learn about software development and systems administration but never been sure
  where to start
* An opportunity to fill in any gaps in your knowledge, if you’re a
  self-taught coder or sysadmin
* The skills to build and deploy open source software, or contribute to
  existing projects

Why we’re offering this:

* The OSL gets a larger pool of candidates to recommend to companies
  interested in recruiting students
* The OSL gets to work with a wider variety of students, which fits better
  with its new status as part of the school of EECS
* The open source community gets more contributors to its projects

Target Audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our goal is to make the DevOps BootCamp program accessible to students and
community members from all different backgrounds. You have to want to learn, and
be willing to ask questions whenever you don't understand something, and be open
to making time to play with the cool tools/toys which we’ll be teaching you
about.

Policies
--------

Attendance
~~~~~~~~~~

Beginning  September 2015, we are planning on meeting at 6pm on Thursdays.
We plan on keeping a persistent schedule from year to year, to maintain consistentcy
and better plan our meetings.

Each meeting's curriculum will build on what you learned the
previous session, but you can catch up on any sessions you miss
`here <https://www.youtube.com/user/OSUOpenSourceLab>`_.

BootCamp leaders will be available at times outside of the regular meetings to
help answer any questions about the training program's content. We will not
spend class time reviewing material for those who skip a lecture. If you
attend a lesson and don't understand something from it, you're welcome to ask
at the meeting, because others very likely have the same concern. But if you want to
make up a class you skipped, it's disrespectful to those who attended to spend
their class time on questions which you could resolve on your own time.

Laptops
~~~~~~~

As the course progresses, you will need a laptop. We hope and recommend that you
will decide to set up your laptop to dual-boot to Linux as the course
progresses, but but it's not required. If you don't own a laptop and are an OSU
student you can check out a laptop from the OSU Library for at least 24 hours
at a time.

Realistically, as long as it's new enough to boot from USB and connect to
wireless networks, your laptop's specifications don't matter much.
If it's so new that its UEFI configuration prevents you from dual-booting with
Linux, it will be powerful enough to run virtual machines. If it's old enough
to be unable to run VMs but still has wireless connectivity, we'll teach you
how to ssh to a remote server to perform more computationally intensive tasks.

If you are not an OSU student and do not have access to a working laptop,
contact the DevOps BootCamp organizers and we'll see whether we can arrange to
loan you something for meetings.

Get Involved
------------

Mailing list
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Join the `mailing list`_ for updates.

IRC
~~~

Join us on ``irc.freenode.net`` in ``#devopsbootcamp`` (students will be setting
up an IRC network for the program in a later lesson).

Website & Curriculum
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you'd like to help edit this site, `email devopsbootcamp`_ or ping anyone in
``#devopsbootcamp`` on Freenode with your github username to get access to the
web site repo.  You'll also want to learn the `ReStructured Text`_ markup
language to edit the site, if you don't already know it.

Meetings
~~~~~~~~

We typically meet weekly in LInC 268 depending on the room schedules.
Please check back later for when our first meeting in the Fall will be.
Recurring meeting times following the first meeting will be decided based on the
availability of those who show up for the first meeting. Last year we met on
Thursdays from 6-8pm.
